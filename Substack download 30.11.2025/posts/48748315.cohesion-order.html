<p>You read the code, you figure out that to make a behavior change you're going to have to change several widely-dispersed spots in the code, and you get grumpy. What to do?</p><p>Re-order the code so the elements you need to change are adjacent. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Cohesion order works for routines in a file--if two routines are coupled, put them next to each other. This works for files in directories--if two files are coupled, put them in the same directory. It even works across repositories--put coupled code in the same repository before changing it.</p><p>Why not just eliminate the coupling? If you know how to do that, go for it. That's the best tidying of all (assuming the Tidying Inequality is satisfied cost(decoupling) + cost(change) &lt; cost(coupling) + cost(change)).</p><ul><li><p>De-coupling can be an intellectual stretch--you don't know how to do it.</p></li><li><p>De-coupling can be a time/money stretch--you could do it but you can't afford the time right now.</p></li><li><p>De-coupling can be a relationship stretch--the team has taken as much change as it can handle right now.</p></li></ul><p>You aren't stuck with Swiss Cheese changes. Tidying can increase cohesion enough to make behavior changes easier. Sometimes the increased clarity from slightly better cohesion unlocks whatever is blocking you from de-coupling. Sometimes better cohesion helps you live with the coupling.</p>
