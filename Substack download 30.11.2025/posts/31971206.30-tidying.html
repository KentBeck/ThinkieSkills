<p>I’m not going to restrict myself to answers here. Sometimes I just have good questions. Here’s one. I was talking to a CTO yesterday who wanted my reaction to having engineering spend 30% of their time “paying down technical debt”. My reaction was immediate, “Terrible idea!”</p><p>But why?</p><p>I don’t know the answer but I suspect it has something to do with time.</p><ul><li><p>The value of tidying peaks just before the behavior change the tidying facilitates. If I Tidy First today, then the tidier system is shiny and clean when I change behavior tomorrow. Net Present Value tells us that spending later and earning sooner are both ways to earn more.</p></li><li><p>The cost of tidying is minimized around, before or after, the behavior change facilitated by the tidying. Just before we know just what needs tidying, so we avoid overdoing it. Just after the code is fresh in our minds and we know exactly what the design would have had to have been for the behavior change to go more smoothly.</p></li></ul><p>Maybe when we take time out of the goal we are prone to tidying the wrong amount at the wrong time. There’s also a psychological/social aspect to it that’s escaping me at the moment.</p>
