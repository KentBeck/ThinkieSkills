<p>Tidyings are potato chips. You eat one, you'll want another. Managing the urge to keep tidying is a key tidying skill. You just tidied, should you tidy more? It depends (&amp; we'll get to what it depends on in the theory section).</p><p>How big you step will be up to you, but I encourage you to experiment with sticking to tiny tidying steps. Optimize each step. From the outside it will look like you are running but, like the centipede, you will know you're taking many little steps.</p><p>Once you're used to it tidying becomes a game of chess</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>, where you start to see several steps ahead. Let's look at how tidyings set up further tidyings.</p><h3>Guard Clause</h3><p>Once you've set up a guard clause, the condition may benefit from being turned into an Explaining Helper or extracted into an Explaining Variable.</p><h3>Dead Code</h3><p>Once you've removed the clutter of dead code, you may be able to see how to sort the code into Reading Order or Cohesion Order.</p><h3>Normalize Symmetries</h3><p>Once you've made identical code identical &amp; different code different, you may be able to group precisely parallel code into Reading Order. I did this once with a file containing several web entry points. Once they all looked alike, it was natural to group them at the top of the file as a kind of table of contents to the rest of the code.</p><h3>New Interface, Old Implementation</h3><p>Once you have your shiny new interface, you'll want to use it. If you don't have the automated rewrite tools to convert all callers, you'll need to convert them one at a time. This is the first time we've seen fanout--when one tidying leads to a bunch more, each of which can lead to a bunch more (way more about this when we talked about coupling &amp; power laws).</p><h3>Reading Order</h3><p>After you've established reading order, you may see the opportunity to Normalize Symmetries. Before, elements were far enough apart that you couldn't see the similarities.</p><h3>Cohesion Order</h3><p>Elements grouped together for Cohesion Order are candidates to be extracted into a sub-element. Creating, for example, a helper object is out of the scope of tidying. As you get comfortable &amp; confident in tidying, though, it's natural to see larger scale design changes that will ease further behavior changes.</p><h3>Explaining Variable</h3><p>The right hand side of the assignment to an Explaining Variable is a candidate for an Explaining Helper (after which you may be able to inline the variable). The explanation offered by the variable name may make a comment redundant--delete it.</p><h3>Explaining Constant</h3><p>Extracting an Explaining Constant leads to Cohesion Order. Grouping constants that change in sync eases future changes.</p><p>There are whole philosophies of where you put constants &amp; how you arrange them. I won't get into all that here--pick something that makes your work easy. Well, easier.</p><h3>Explicit Parameters</h3><p>After making parameters explicit you may be able to group a set of parameters into an object &amp; move code into that object. This is out of scope as a tidying, but be on the lookout for new abstractions revealed as you tidy. Some of the most powerful abstractions you will ever discover derive from running code. You would never have created them on speculation.</p><h3>Chunk Statements</h3><p>You can precede each chunk with an Explaining Comment. You may extract a chunk as an Explaining Helper.</p><h3>One Pile</h3><p>After making a big, obvious mess, expect to tidy by Chunking Statements, adding Explaining Comments, &amp; Extracting Helpers.</p><h3>Explaining Comment</h3><p>Move the information in the comment into the code if possible, by introducing an Explaining Variable, Explaining Constant, or Explaining Helper.</p><h3>Delete Redundant Comment</h3><p>Eliminating the noise of redundant comments can help you see a better Reading Order or see the chance for Explicit Parameters.</p><p>I'm going to emphasize once again, since I get accused of being anti-comment, that you should only delete absolutely, completely redundant comments. You should also tidy with an eye towards making comments absolutely, completely redundant. Your job as a software designer is to set yourself &amp; your team up for success, now and in the future.</p><p>Since change is the dominant cost of software development &amp; understanding code is the dominant cost of change, communicating the structure &amp; intent of working code is one of the most valuable skills you can exercise. Comments are <em>a</em> form of communication, but tidying lets you explore the limits of communicating through the other elements of programming.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>You will begin to flow tidyings together to achieve larger changes to the structure of your code. Be wary of changing too much too fast. A failed tidying is expensive relative to the cost of a series of successful tidying. Practice tidyings like the notes of a scale. When the notes are clean &amp; relaxed, you can form them into melodies.</p>
