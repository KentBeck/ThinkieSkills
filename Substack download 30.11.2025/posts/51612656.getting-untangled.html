<p>You're changing the behavior of some code. You see a tidying that would make it easier to change. You tidy. Then you write another test case. Now you need to change the behavior some more. That leads to more tidying. An hour later you:</p><ul><li><p>Actually understand all the behavior changes that need to be made.</p></li><li><p>Actually understand all the tidying that eases those behavior changes.</p></li><li><p>But you have a mess of tidyings &amp; changes all tangled together.</p></li></ul><p>You have at least 3 options, none of them attractive:</p><ul><li><p>Ship it as is. This is impolite to reviewers &amp; prone to errors but it's quick.</p></li><li><p>Untangle the tidyings and changes into separate PRs, or a sequence of PRs, or a sequence of commits in a single PR. This is more polite but it can be a lot of work.</p></li><li><p>Discard your work in progress &amp; start over, tidying first. This is more work but it leaves a coherent chain of commits.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div></li></ul><p>Sunk Cost Fallacy complicates the choice between these options. You have some new tests. They pass. Why would you want to throw that away?</p><p>And the answer, as always, is because you are not just instructing a computer, you are explaining your intentions for the computer to other people. The shortest path to instructing the computer is not an interesting end goal (when we talk about make it run/make it right we'll talk about how it <em>is</em> an interesting intermediate goal).</p><p>By this point in the book it may not surprise you that I encourage you to experiment with the last option. Re-implementation raises the possibility that you will see something new as you re-implement, letting you squeeze more value out of the same set of behavioral changes.</p><p>Untangling a ball of yarn starts with noticing that you have a tangle. The sooner you realize the need to untangle, the smaller the job (&amp; the less important the decision between the strategies above). When you first begin consciously tidying, whether first or after, you'll likely miss the transition between "cruising along making changes" &amp; "oh no, what all have I done?". Don't worry. You'll get better at sequencing tidyings &amp; changes over time.</p><p>Speaking of "first or after", it's time to talk about timing.</p>
