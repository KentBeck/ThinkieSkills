<p>Let's go back to the beginning. You are tidying to make future changes to the behavior of the system easier. You are making future behavior changes easier because you're worth it (we'll get into the economics later, if anyone objects). What are we talking about here? A brief moment then back to the slog? Hour upon hour of blissful tidying?</p><p>Part of the art of managing tidying is managing the rhythm of it. In the previous chapter we saw this picture, encouraging smaller batches of tidying:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png" width="1456" height="595" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:595,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2451211,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-TlU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae11e7b3-fab5-4a7a-beb2-caf8a701825a_2370x969.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>How much time is represented in one of those succession of structure changes followed by a behavior change?</p><p>Well, software design is fractal, so it could be any time scale. For purposes of this book, however, we are talking about one scale of software design: software design with personal impact. For that, we are talking about minutes up to an hour. More than an hour of tidying at a time before making a behavior change likely means you've lost track of the minimum set of structure changes needed to enable your desired behavior change.</p><p>Another option, though, is that the code is in such a mess that you can profitably tidy for hours before making a behavior change. If this is true, it won't be true for long. Software design has a strong "pave the path" tendency.</p><p>If you haven't heard that story, here's how it goes: a college built a bunch of buildings &amp; the planners were trying to figure out where to put walking paths between them. Rather than make carefully educated guesses, however, they just planted all the area between the buildings with grass.</p><p>A few months later, students' feet had worn paths in the grass. The planners paved those areas worn smooth.</p><p>Behavior changes tend to cluster in the code. From Pareto, 80% of the the changes will occur in 20% of the files. One of the beauties of tidying first is that the tidyings cluster too. And they cluster in exactly those spots most attractive for behavior changes.</p><p>Even if at first you tidy a <em>lot</em>, soon you will find yourself wanting to make a behavior change in code that's already tidy. Continue for a bit &amp; most changes will happen in already-tidied areas of the code. Eventually encountering un-tidy code will be the exception, even though most of the code in the system hasn't been touched.</p><p>That's why I'm confident in saying that tidying is a minutes-to-an-hour kind of activity. Yes, sometimes it goes longer, but not for long.</p>
