<blockquote><p>Thank you all for the feedback on the previous chapter. I think the result is much improved. This week we have the technical meat of the briefing—coupling. Should the gears analogy be up front or where it is?</p></blockquote><p>Why does software, seemingly straightforward at the outset, morph into a financial black hole as it accumulates mass? The initial development cost, while not negligible, pales in comparison to the cumulative expense of post-release changes. It’s easy to say, "Well, if the programmers did a better job, we wouldn’t get into this mess." Turns out that software development is subject to the same natural laws that cause hurricaines, avalanches, and (more positively) blockbuster movies.</p><p>Surprisingly, a few, particularly onerous, changes drive the cost of change. What transforms these changes from mere adjustments into financial sinkholes?</p><h2><strong>The Avalanche Effect of Coupling</strong></h2><p>Imagine software design as an intricately woven tapestry, where each thread’s adjustment could potentially necessitate reweaving vast sections. This interconnectedness, or "coupling," is the crux of the issue. Coupling occurs when elements within our software conduct change from one element to another. You’ll sometimes see a comment in the code, "If you change this function be sure to also change that function over there." This is coupling.</p><p>One change necessitating one other change is double the cost, but it’s not a jackpot. However, every change to any part of the system has some probability of conducting a change. A change here means those 2 elements need to change. Oh, yeah, and those changes lead to 6 more. One of those leads to, oh dear, 12 more changes. And suddenly you’re in the middle of a story that will scare new team members for years.</p><p>This process is natural. There’s no escaping coupling, just as when there is snow on a slope there are going to be avalanches. The leadership challenge is to encourage lots of tiny avalanches instead of one catastrophe. (Recall from the previous chapter we talked about how every you should see some structure changes.)</p><h2><strong>Constantine’s Equivalence: A Measure of Cost</strong></h2><p>Larry Constantine’s insight into the nature of software costs starts by noting that most of the cost of software is in the cost of change:</p><pre><code>  cost(software) ~= cost(change)</code></pre><p>All the little changes don’t add up to much, it is the jackpot changes that drive up the cost of software:</p><pre><code>  cost(software) ~= cost(change) ~= cost(big changes)</code></pre><p>Those big jackpot changes, in turn, are a result of coupling:</p><pre><code>cost(software) ~= cost(change) ~= cost(big changes) ~= cost(coupling)</code></pre><p>While managing the cost of software may feel overwhelming, it reduces to managing coupling:</p><pre><code>  cost(software) ~= cost(coupling)</code></pre><h2><strong>Managing Coupling to Control Costs</strong></h2><p>Okay, it’s a tiny bit more complicated than that, because removing coupling doesn’t come for free. Structure changes can remove coupling, but they require investment. The equation you’re juggling is:</p><pre><code>  cost(software) ~= cost(coupling) + cost(decoupling)</code></pre><p>The key to controlling software development costs, then, is managing coupling. By designing systems where components are loosely coupled, we can mitigate the cascade effect of changes. Loose coupling allows for parts of the system to be modified with minimal impact on others, significantly reducing the scope and, consequently, the cost of changes.</p><h2><strong>Illustrating the Concept: A Visual Analogy</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg" width="512" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:48924,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!15g3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F573ac62b-9595-4501-bf70-c8e075b33fca_512x288.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Imagine a network of gears, where turning one gear sets the entire system in motion. In a tightly coupled system, every gear is interlocked, so moving one requires an orchestrated effort to adjust the others. The cost and complexity of changing the system are high because of the extensive coordination required.</p><p>Now, envision a modular setup where gears are connected through clutches that can be engaged or disengaged. This design allows for individual gears to be adjusted without necessitating widespread modifications. This modular, loosely coupled system embodies the ideal in software design—flexibility, adaptability, and reduced cost of changes.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: A Path to Efficiency</strong></h2><p>By understanding and addressing the intricacies of coupling and cohesion in software design, we can pave the way for more efficient, adaptable, and cost-effective development. This chapter has laid the foundation for appreciating the economic impact of design choices and set the stage for exploring strategies to minimize coupling, thereby controlling the hidden costs of software evolution.</p><p>If removing coupling were easy, everyone would just do it all the time. Sometimes, though, eliminating coupling for one kind of features creates coupling for other kinds of features. And sometimes you can’t see how to remove coupling at all. All is not lost, though, as we see in the following chapter. Increasing cohesion, the dual of coupling, also reduces the cost of coupling &amp; can lead to future improvements.</p>
