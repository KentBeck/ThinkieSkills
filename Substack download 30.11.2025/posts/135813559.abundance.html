<p>I’m enjoying writing Thinkies. Usually I carefully craft what I write as a tradeoff. I often dig deep into “why it works”. My experience is that some people will thoughtlessly copy what I (and others) say, then come back later &amp; blame me for their results. Test-Driven Development is prone to that—”I tried what you said &amp; it made me fail. I wrote the tests after, not before. And I designed the whole thing up front because I had to. And it takes me 30 hours to run the tests. But your advice is BAD &amp; you should feel BAD &amp; you’re the reason I’m single &amp; homeless!”</p><p>Not with Thinkies. See this pattern? Try this thing. Judge the result. The responsibility for evaluation &amp; execution is clearly, entirely on you. Oh, it didn’t work? That’s because it usually doesn’t work.</p><p>I know I’ll still get blamed because hey people are people. But for the moment I just don’t care. And that makes writing so much more fun.</p><p>(It’s also safer to write here because it’s only for paid subscribers &amp; y’all are per definition smarter &amp; more responsible than average.)</p><p>Today’s project Thinkie is Abundance.</p><p>Pattern: You’re cutting corners because you have too much to do/not enough time.</p><p>Transformation: What would you do if you had enough time?</p><p>Some of the activities you come up with you may not be able to do for now. Others may actually be cheap &amp; pay off quickly enough that they put you in a better place.</p>
