<blockquote><p>This is my new <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/about">About page</a>. Please let me know what you think, what questions are left unanswered, what would make it clearer, &amp; how you feel about it if you feel some kind of way.</p></blockquote><p>I’m Kent Beck &amp; my mission is to help geeks feel safe in the world.</p><ol><li><p>Help. I can’t make anyone else feel anything but I can help.</p></li><li><p>Geeks. I speak first to people like me, geeks, who care about mechanisms &amp; puzzles &amp; surprising ideas.</p></li><li><p>Feel. Living in my head most of the time divorced me from my emotions, which came back to bite me later. Hard. So I talk about emotions but also ideas from the perspective of how they affect &amp; are affected by feelings.</p></li><li><p>Safe. I often feel unsafe in situations where I’m perfectly safe, like a cocktail party. Sometimes I feel safe in situations where I’m acting unsafe, like pushing code that will break the system. I want my feelings of safety (or unsafety) to match the facts.</p></li><li><p>In the world. Yes I talk about programming &amp; software development, but I have learned my skills in the world at large contribute to my geeky pursuits &amp; my geeky skills can contribute to the rest of my life.</p></li></ol><h2>How Did I Discover My Mission?</h2><p>I looked at the things I had done in the first 2 decades of <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/ideas-ive-contributed-to-in-software">my career</a> &amp; asked what in the world tied together patterns, JUnit, TDD, &amp; Extreme Programming? The phrase, helping geeks feel safe in the world, popped into my head.</p><p>At first I thought what in the world does <em>that</em> mean? Then I realized that feeling safe when I was actually safe was a desperate wish of mine. I was beset by anxiety at the time. Each of the projects above increased safety:</p><ul><li><p>Patterns—Design discussions that are more likely to result in shared understanding &amp; agreement.</p></li><li><p>JUnit—Does this code work? The answer is a button press away. (I used to press the button 2 or 3 times if I <em>really</em> needed reassurance.)</p></li><li><p>TDD—Do I know what the code is supposed to do? If I’m under time pressure, how will I know the code works?</p></li><li><p>Extreme Programming—A whole set of safety-enhanced personal interactions.</p></li></ul><h2>Why A Newsletter with Paying Subscribers?</h2><p>I needed new incentives. I started working actively on software design in 2005, although my interest went back to the 80s. You’ll notice that’s quite a while ago. I just wasn’t writing. What’s going to get me over my inertia?</p><p>Turns out, the answer is “$7/month”. When I see a new subscriber, I want to deliver them something worthwhile. When I lose a subscriber, oh my, I want to deliver something valuable.</p><p>With paying subscribers I don’t take my readers’ interest for granted. This leads me to take my responsibility to communicate more seriously.</p><p>I expected a few friends-and-family to sign up. That would have been enough to keep me writing. I was shocked to discover that paying subscribers could actually free up my time to think &amp; write more. And the ceiling is much higher—paying subscribers potentially could <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/kent-beck-business">fund my retirement</a>. But I’m going to need to keep creating value for that to happen.</p><h2>Why subscribe?</h2><p>I asked this question when I got to hundreds of paying subscribers. The answers clustered around:</p><ul><li><p>Gratitude for ideas I’ve contributed to in the past.</p></li><li><p>Gratitude &amp; encouragement for the ideas I’m working on now.</p></li></ul><p>With the help of a business coach, I acknowledged just how much gratitude I feel for the freedom my paying subscribers afford me. In return, I began publishing Thinkies, habits of creative thought. You’ll get one every Tuesday.</p><p>Thinkies resulted from my introspection on ideas of mine that other people label “creative”. I noticed that most of my ideas result from identifiable habits of thinking, not from some mysterious tap on the forehead from a Muse.</p><p>Ordinarily I wouldn’t publish a project this early, but I wanted to express my gratitude to my paying subscribers. I began publishing something unique. I like the idea that I can identify the first thousand people to hear about one of my ideas. The conversation around each Thinkie has been amazing.</p><p>The other content for paying subscribers is fully drafted chapters from my books on software design. Since the first book is done &amp; I haven’t started the second, there aren’t any of these at the moment.</p><h3>Join the crew</h3><p>Be part of a community of people who care about the hard questions of software design:</p><ul><li><p>When?</p></li><li><p>Why?</p></li><li><p>How much?</p></li><li><p>Who?</p></li></ul><p>And most importantly:</p><ul><li><p>How’s that feel?</p></li></ul><p>To find out more about the author visit <a href="http://kentbeck.com/">KentBeck.com</a>.</p>
