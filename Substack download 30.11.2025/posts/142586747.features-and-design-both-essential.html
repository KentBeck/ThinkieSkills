<blockquote><p>I got great feedback that the <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/features-and-design-a-dance-of-contrasts">previous version of this chapter</a> relied too heavily on analogies. Here it is written in a more straightforward style. If you’re an executive, does this work better for you? If you’re not, would you feel better handing this to an executive?</p></blockquote><p>Distinguish between 2 kinds of programming:</p><ul><li><p>Programming that results in an externally-visible feature.</p></li><li><p>Programming that improves the ability to develop future features.</p></li></ul><p>Both are programming. They can’t (or at least shouldn’t) be done at the same time. But a balance between them, or rather a rhythm, is what creates the Surprise Factory. I say "rhythm" instead of "balance" because balance implies static allocation—80% features &amp; 20% structure. The Surprise Factory, instead, thrives on adapting dynamically—70/30 this month, 30/70 next month.</p><p>Your role is to steer this bicycle a little this way, a little that way, to keep those happy surprises coming.</p><h2><strong>Behavior Changes: Features for the Audience</strong></h2><p>Behavior changes in software are observable modifications that impact how users interact with the system. These can range from new features, such as a button that does something, to optimizations that streamline operations or reduce costs. Each behavior change should lead to an improvement in the Net Present Value (NPV) of the software, either by boosting revenue or cutting expenses.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png" width="1456" height="350" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:350,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1483481,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DIia!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F060495d0-c784-4443-aaee-b7c617aa43d9_3155x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>For example, introducing a new payment option could directly increase sales, while optimizing an algorithm might reduce server costs.

Done right, they won’t see any immediate effect from structure changes. What they will see, with proper stewardship of structure, is the continued stream of happy surprises.</p><p>Improving the software’s structure enhances its optionality, making it easier to implement new behavior later. Structure improvements amplify the value of the software by preserving and expanding its future possibilities.</p><p>Some structure changes do improve NPV, by reducing the cost of future features &amp; bringing those features to market sooner. This introduces a tradeoff:</p><ul><li><p>Design more now for the promise of future improvement?</p></li><li><p>Implement features now, even at a cost to the structure of the system &amp; thus a sacrifice of future NPV?</p></li></ul><p>The information required to make this tradeoff between a feature investment now or a structure investment now doesn’t exist at the moment you have to decide, so judgement, principles, &amp; hedging are all required to maintain an effective rhythm. You as an executive have broader perspective than the individuals involved, even though you have less detailed information.</p><h2><strong>The Reversibility of Structure Changes</strong></h2><p>Structure changes differ fundamentally from behavior changes in <em>reversibility</em>. Structure changes, being internal, can often be undone with minimal fallout, allowing for a more experimental approach. If a new architecture doesn’t yield the expected improvements, reverting to the previous state is usually straightforward, quick, and cost-effective.</p><p>Behavior changes, on the other hand, are akin to a live performance; once you’ve changed the script and performed in front of the audience, there’s no simple undo button. The stakes are higher, and the cost of reversal, both in terms of resources and reputation, can be significant. This is why behavior changes necessitate rigorous testing—-ensuring that new features perform as intended.</p><h2><strong>Encouraging a Dual Approach</strong></h2><p>The distinct risk profiles of behavior and structure changes imply that they require different management strategies. For behavior changes, thorough testing and validation ensure that the new or altered behavior performs as expected and does not introduce unforeseen issues. For structure changes, while testing remains important, there’s more room for exploration and iteration, given their reversible nature.</p><p>Encourage your teams to clearly distinguish between these two types of change. In a given year, you’ll see some feature work &amp; some structure work. Same in a given month. In a given day, one or the other may predominate. Encourage teams to steer a little this way, a little that way, &amp; to not mix behavior &amp; structure changes.</p><h2><strong>Why So Much?</strong></h2><p>Separating structure and behavior changes is not just a technicality but a strategic approach to enhancing software value—features for cash flow, structure for options. By understanding and leveraging this distinction, you can guide teams toward decisions that not only improve the software’s current state but also secure its adaptability and success in the future.</p><p>Technical factors drive the cost and complexity of software. Understanding these cost drivers sharpens your intuition about the needed rhythm of structure &amp; behavior change. Next up are coupling and cohesion—the equivalent of the law of gravity for the cost of software development.</p>
