<p>The motto of my work on software design is, “Software design is an exercise in human relationships.” I didn’t know what this meant when I wrote it, but as <em>Tidy First?</em> takes shape I’m beginning to understand.</p><p>Yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg rolled out a new motto for Facebook: “Meta, Metamates, Me”. Aside from being cringy &amp; culty &amp; exploitable, this is exactly backward of how I’m approaching writing about software design. (There’s lots more to say about the history of self-abnegation propaganda in tech, but I digress…)</p><p>Book writing is an exercise in scope slashing. I always start writing about a topic that is too small to fill a whole book, realize it’s way too big for a book, slash it back to a topic that is too small to fill a while book, then… The most times I’ve been through this loop is 4 before I got a book-sized topic.</p><p>https://www.reactiongifs.us/let-me-explain-the-princess-bride/</p><p>Software design is good example. I wanted to write about coupling &amp; cohesion, Newton’s Laws of Motion for software development. That proved too large a topic, so I slashed scope to incremental design. Again, too large, so I slashed scope to this moment that occurs 10 times in every developers day: I have to change this code, it’s messy, do I <em>Tidy First?</em></p><p>What does this have to do with human relationships? As it turns out, I can see 3 circles of relationships affected by software design:</p><ul><li><p>Self. How do I treat myself as a programmer? At times I’ve had an abusive relationship with myself. This code sucks? Well I’m just going to have to power through it. It’s like walking with too-tight shoes. Tidying is geek self-care. Do I value myself enough to make my work easier?</p></li><li><p>Team. How do we treat each other as programmers? Software design choices affect other people. If I change an API you use, I’ve just caused you pain. Maybe it’s worth it in the long run &amp; maybe not, but if I want to be effective as a designer I’d better be prepared to acknowledge &amp; address the relationship effects of my “technical” decisions.</p></li><li><p>Product. How do programmers treat non-programmers? The classic recurring relationship is between Product &amp; Engineering (&amp; also Design &amp; Data). Software design decisions affect these often-fraught relationships. How can we establish boundaries &amp; then care for each other through (&amp; in spite of) software design decisions?</p></li></ul><p>So this work is looking like a trilogy. <em>Tidy First?</em> is about our relationship with ourselves. The next book will be about teams of people sharing a technical design space &amp; ethically &amp; thoughtfully nurturing their relationships. The last book will be, given reasonably healthy relationships among a team of reasonably healthy geeks, how can they extend care to a larger, not-so-obviously aligned, definitely not so geeky community.</p>
