<p>You have a software project. The regulators say you have to deliver a project with variations for all 50 states (American-centric, I know) by a certain date or 💀. You have 5 months. How do you structure the project?</p><ul><li><p>Deliver all states with a calculated amount of buffer, say get done in 4 months so you have a month of slack.</p></li><li><p>10 states a month. Implement the most important ones first, or the riskiest ones first, or the ones that will teach you the most. If you get to the end of month 2 &amp; you’re not on track, you’ll send up the Bat Signal.</p></li><li><p>Do the jankiest conceivable job of all 50 states in the first 2 months—manual processes, plain text documents, PNAMBIC. Then optimize for the next 3 months.</p></li></ul><p>Pattern: You have a project that requires many fairly independent pieces.</p><p>Transformation: Radically scale back your ambitions for the pieces &amp; deliver all of them in a first pass, then go through all the pieces &amp; improve them.</p><p>It’s the 💀 that really gets me. Your incentives are asymmetrical. If you deliver, pat on the back. If you don’t deliver, really bad stuff. If you deliver early or better than expected, pat on the back. Organize the project around the incentives.</p><p>No one wants to operate a system built out of the worst conceivable solutions to every problem. However, that’s better than not operating the system at all because the company is gone.</p><p>The first two approach, deliver all or deliver N/M in M slices, suffer from accelerating anxiety. The closer you get to the deadline, the more stress, which is the opposite of what you need. One Pass Quickly, One Pass Good alleviates the threat of failure early, so you have experience, confidence, &amp; energy to make the system better in ways that turn out to matter.</p><p>Thanks to <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The Second 90%&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:175493,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;pub&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/annagoodman&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:null,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;9e9e3345-9d6a-477e-a9b2-d5d2d9b1554b&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> Anna Goodman for the inspiration for this Thinkie.
