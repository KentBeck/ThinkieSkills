There is in my head but it wasn’t on the diagram.</p><p>Pattern: The team is being tugged in so many directions by so many people that they can’t make progress on anything.</p><p>Transformation: Have the customer speak with one voice. This can be a single representative. Or they can just all just show up Monday morning.</p><p>This is a dangerous one because it silences some people, lengthens feedback loops, &amp; creates incentives to accelerate both trends (the product organization becomes a power player eager to maintain &amp; expand its power). However, it is better than true chaos.</p>
