<p>Pattern: the team is stuck solving a complicated problem. They are focused on complicated solutions.</p><p>Transformation: you ask, “Why is this any more complicated than &lt;naive solution&gt;?”</p><p>This is one of a class of Thinkies that work not because you have superior skill, but because you maintain perspective while others are stuck in a local maximum. I like these because I don’t have to work hard, I don’t have to compete, I just have to maintain composure. I can be valuable out of all proportion to my technical skill. (I’ve lived most of my technical life in terror that my skills won’t be good enough.)</p><p>This is also a dual-purpose Thinkie. It can work by getting the team onto a new track. Even if it doesn’t, though, I learn something. The explanation helps me understand better. The act of explaining also helps the team understand their situation better. The only way this Thinkie can completely lose is if I interrupt the team just as they are about to make progress.</p><p>As always, the examples are the hard part. Anyone have a good example?</p>
