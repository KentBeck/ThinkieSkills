<p>Thinkie Easy Bit follows from Thinkie Hard Problem, at least it does for me.</p><p>Pattern: You’re paralyzed by the magnitude of the problem facing you.</p><p>Transformation: Pick the absolutely easiest thing to do that will help &amp; do it.</p><p>I’ve come to believe that confidence &amp; energy are more important than ideas. With confidence &amp; energy I can (with the help of Thinkies 😉) come up with plenty of ideas. Without confidence &amp; energy I can’t execute no matter how many or how good my ideas.</p><p>Thinkie Hard Problem unblocks energy by acknowledging the whole problem, knowing that you’re not sweeping anything under the carpet. But hard problems can also be overwhelming—where do I start? how can I ever get all this done?</p><p>When I’m stuck, anything I accomplish helps. Rename that directory. Set up that account. Ask Perplexity for a tutorial. Heck, tidy your desk. (No, nail care doesn’t count, as many times as I try that.)</p><p>I’m a to-do list person. When I’m really stuck, I accomplish an Easy Bit, write it on my list, &amp; cross it off. Feels strange, but it contributes to my confidence &amp; energy. Would it be better not to have this much anxiety? Sure. I’m working on that. But I’m here, today, &amp; I have goals.</p><p>Next week we’ll have an alternative Thinkie for when you’re stuck, Fun Bit.</p>
