<p><em>How do teams grow software together, despite differing goals, differing perspectives, and different incentives?</em></p><p>In <em>Tidy First?</em> I focused on you the programmer—your relationship with your code, your willingness to invest a few minutes making your work easier before diving into the hard stuff. That book was about moments of design, small acts of care that accumulate into better software and a better day at work.</p><p><em>Tidy Together</em> expands the circle. Now we're talking about teams, about the delicate dance of multiple people changing the same system without stepping on each other's toes. The stakes are higher here because software design is an exercise in human relationships. Let me say that again because it's the foundation of everything that follows: if your software is beautiful according to every aesthetic criterion you can imagine, but your team can't stand working together, you've failed as a designer.</p><p>I've seen it happen. Brilliant technical decisions that poison relationships. Elegant architectures that become weapons in power struggles. Perfect abstractions that nobody understands or wants to maintain. The software might be gorgeous, but the people who have to live with it every day are miserable. That's not success—that's self-indulgence disguised as craft.</p><h2>Software Is Grown, Not Assembled</h2><p>I was shocked when the first words of <em>Tidy First?</em> coming out of my fingers were, "Software design is an exercise in human relationships". I thought I was going to focus on technical factors--coupling, cohesion, complexity partitioning. Instead I dove into caring for ones-self as a programmer. After all, if you can't care for yourself you can't care for others.</p><p>The one startling sentence of this book is a bit more technical—the idea that explains much of our disagreement with other software design advice—is this: <strong>software is grown, not assembled</strong>.</p><p>Most design advice assumes you can specify what you want, build it, and ship it. Like constructing a bridge or manufacturing a car. You plan extensively up front because changes later are expensive. You optimize for predictability because deviations from the plan cost money.</p><p>Software isn't like that. Software responds to its environment. It adapts to new requirements, new constraints, new opportunities. The most successful software systems are the ones that can evolve gracefully, that can incorporate changes without breaking what came before. They're grown iteratively, shaped by use, pruned and tended like a garden.</p><p>This organic metaphor changes everything. In a factory, you want identical parts performing identical functions. In a garden, you want healthy growth patterns that can respond to changing seasons. In software development, you want teams that can learn together, designs that can accommodate surprise, and practices that compound rather than merely accumulate.</p><p>When you accept that software is grown, not assembled, you stop trying to get the design "right" up front and start trying to get it "growable." You invest in the soil—tests, tooling, team dynamics—as much as in the plants themselves. You tend the system continuously rather than building it once.</p><h2>How This Book Differs</h2><p><em>Tidy First?</em> gave you techniques you could apply immediately, by yourself, in the next fifteen minutes of your workday. The refactorings in this book may require coordination. They span multiple classes, multiple modules. They affect multiple people's work. Some require explicit negotiation about priorities and tradeoffs.</p><p>Where <em>Tidy First?</em> focused on the cognitive load of individual programmers, <em>Tidy Together</em> focuses on the social dynamics of teams. How do you propose a significant structural change without threatening your colleagues? How do you maintain momentum on features while investing in architecture? How do you build consensus around design decisions when smart people reasonably disagree?</p><p>The economics are different too. When you tidy by yourself, the costs and benefits accrue mostly to you. When you tidy together, you're asking others to pay costs today for benefits they might not see until later. That requires a different kind of conversation, a different kind of trust.</p><h2>Structure of This Book</h2><p>Following the pattern from <em>Tidy First?</em>, we start with the concrete and work toward the abstract:</p><p><strong>Part I: Refactorings</strong> presents techniques for changing code structure at the next scale up from tidyings. Each refactoring includes not just the mechanical steps, but guidance on when to apply it, how to sequence the work, and how to maintain safety when the changes span multiple pull requests.</p><p><strong>Part II: Management</strong> addresses the human challenges of design work at team scale. How do you decide when to invest in structure versus rushing to ship features? One of the big surprises to many readers of <em>Tidy First?</em> was optionality--the idea that design creates economic value by increasing options. The options in <em>Tidy First?</em> were tiny. The options created by the refactorings here begin to show up on the radar of non-programmers.</p><p>How do you maintain relationships when some people want to refactor and others just want to implement? How do you create space for design improvement without losing momentum on product development?</p><p><strong>Part III: Theory</strong> digs into the forces that make collaborative design work. Why do power laws govern software complexity? What does it mean for software systems to survive or die? How do you evaluate design decisions when the information you need doesn't exist? This isn't abstract mathematical theory—it's the conceptual framework that helps you make better judgments when the cookbook doesn't have an answer.</p><h2>How I Came to Write These Books</h2><p>Twenty years ago, I promised to bring Ed Yourdon and Larry Constantine's insights about software design to a modern audience. <em>Structured Design</em> was revolutionary when it appeared in 1979, but the examples with paper tape and magnetic tape were showing their age. The principles, though—coupling, cohesion, the relationship between structure and cost—those were eternal.</p><p>I made several false starts. Each time I tried to tackle all of software design in one book, and each time I discovered the topic was impossibly large. Eventually I realized I needed to slice the problem differently.</p><p><em>Tidy First?</em> addressed the moment of individual decision-making: "I need to change this code, and it's messy. What should I do?" That question came up constantly in what I had drafted, so I pulled it out and wrote a whole book around it.</p><p><em>Tidy Together</em> addresses the next layer: "We need to change this system, and it's becoming unwieldy. How do we improve it without disrupting everything else we're trying to accomplish?" This is where design becomes social, where technical decisions bump up against human dynamics.</p><p>The third book in this series will address the relationship between people who build software and people who use it—business stakeholders, customers, the broader organization. That's where design becomes political, where the consequences of our technical choices ripple out into the world.</p><h2>My Hope for You</h2><p>I want you to experience the deep satisfaction of working on a system that improves over time, with colleagues who trust each other enough to make bold changes. I want you to feel the compounding effect of small, careful improvements accumulating into large capabilities. I want you to see how attention to design relationships parallels and enables attention to human relationships.</p><p>Most of all, I want you to understand that we're not just writing code—we're growing systems that will outlive our involvement with them, systems that will need to adapt to futures we can't imagine. The choices we make about structure, about process, about how we work together, shape not just what we build but who we become in the building.</p><p>Software design is an exercise in human relationships. Let's exercise together.</p>
