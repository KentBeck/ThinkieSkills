<p>Following up on Thinkie Hard Problem &amp; Thinkie Easy Bit.</p><p>Pattern: you’re paralyzed by the size &amp; complexity of the problem you’re addressing.</p><p>Transformation: pick the bit of it that will be the most fun &amp; do that.</p><p>This is another confidence/energy management strategy. What would be fun? What have you always wanted to do but haven’t? What’s something you’ve done before that you’ve enjoyed.</p><p>Part of the paralysis I feel confronting a big, complicated problem is that I want to do The Best Thing next. Anything I choose to do, I can argue for why it isn’t The Best Thing.</p><p>Addressing big, complicated problems is always under-constrained. The information needed to make a perfect, rational decision about what to do next, that information simply doesn’t exist at the moment I’m deciding.</p><p>Instead of “best”, I just need to do <em>something</em> that doesn’t hurt the situation &amp; that gives me confidence &amp; energy for the next thing. Optimizing for fun is one way to encourage confidence &amp; energy.</p><p>Don’t do the Fun Bit too long. Accomplish something. Share your victory. Then step back &amp; run the Thinkies again.</p>
