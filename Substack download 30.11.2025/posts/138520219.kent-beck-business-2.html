<p>This is going to be a rather long &amp; dark intro, I’m afraid. It’s necessary to explain where I am right now.</p><p>“I can’t wait for the chili!” S called brightly from her car as she drove past. I participate in a close-knit San Francisco neighborhood. The Halloween chili feast has been a neighborhood fixture for decades. Everybody gathers in costume, eats chili, drinks too much, catches up on all the gossip, &amp; stumbles home happy.</p><p>We knew that this year was going to have a sad undertone. D, a long-time neighbor, had just died of cancer. She was my age. Last year she was fine—costumed, bright, energetic. January—diagnosis. October—gone. Everyone was going to miss her.</p><p>D’s passing was a reminder of mortality, a reminder to squeeze the juice from each day. It could all be taken away by next year.</p><p>Once the party started, “Where’s S?” “Oh, you didn’t hear? She died of a heart attack.”</p><p>Boom. Two days ago she was ready to party. Today she’s gone.</p><p>Somehow S’s passing hit even harder than D’s. This wasn’t a months-long, painful decline, with sad goodbyes, with poignant last-times. This was boom boom out go the lights. No chance for reconciliation. No closure. Just gone. And it could be me. And I’d never see it coming.</p><h2>So?</h2><p>Now I’m crying. You might be crying. Take a minute to breathe. What does this mean for my business?</p><p>I optimized my newsletter further last week. I wrote some decent prose to be delivered to highly engaged readers talking about how much I appreciate the freedom afforded me by paying subscribers &amp; how I express that appreciation. Lo &amp; behold, the numbers went up a little.</p><p>I had the familiar emotional reactions—frustration that I’m not already secure, shame that I’m trying to get something from folks, fear of being my manipulative grandfather. (Just because I realized how messed up I was about being in business doesn’t mean my problems were all solved. You’ve got to outgrow issues like this, not solve them, &amp; that takes time.)</p><p>What I noticed also, &amp; this is the real point of this post, is that I was periodically worrying about business during the day. I’d be walking along or typing along or cooking along &amp; out would pop the worry bug. “Yeah, but is the newsletter thing played out?” “Yeah, but what if none of the investments pays off?” “Yeah, but how significant is a book anyway given your timeline &amp; fixed costs?”</p><p>That’s what the sadness double whammy of this week teaches me—the utter futility of those thoughts &amp; feelings.</p><h2>Insert Logic</h2><p>When I habitually do or think or say something that I want to change, my process is:</p><ol><li><p>Stretch out the time involved in the incident to see how it progresses.</p></li><li><p>Find the false belief in that sequence.</p></li><li><p>Formulate a piece of logic I can repeat to interrupt the sequence.</p></li></ol><p>I expect to live a reducing financial lifestyle in the future. That’s just the numbers. Expenses (spousal support) stays fixed. Income (without changes) declines. This is not an irrational fear. It’s my arithmetic.</p><p>What is wasteful is worrying about it. I need to do what I can do given my situation &amp; capabilities &amp; then let the chips fall. In the meantime, live my life.</p><p>Stretching out the timeline of a moment of worry it looks something like: remember that I don’t know where February’s money is coming from → feel frustrated that I have to think about it → feel envious of friends who have financial security. The false beliefs?</p><ul><li><p>I deserve not to think about finances.</p></li><li><p>Everyone else is comfortable.</p></li></ul><p>(Identifying false beliefs is always uncomfortable. Some of the things I apparently believe are absolutely absurd.)</p><p>Inserting logic:</p><ul><li><p>I deserve not to think about finances → what can I do about this right now? If there’s something to do, do it. If not, keep walking.</p></li><li><p>Everyone else is comfortable → I can only influence my own situation.</p></li></ul><p>We’ll see if that helps.</p><h2>Lessons</h2><p>I take 2 lessons from my friends who died (&amp; the ones with MS &amp; the ones with Parkinsons &amp; …):</p><ul><li><p>Worry about finances is a waste of precious seconds on this planet. Those seconds aren’t just lost, the opportunity to enjoy or appreciate one of my many blessings is also lost. I could have good seconds &amp; instead I’m choosing to have bad seconds.</p></li><li><p>Depriving myself today against an uncertain future is a lost opportunity. I could scrimp &amp; save &amp; still have it all taken away from me. All that sacrifice &amp; no payoff.</p></li><li><p>But also, the mortality table says I need to be prepared another 10 or 20 or 30 years &amp; I’d like those years to be as comfortable as possible. I can’t just blow it all today.</p></li></ul><p>I guess this is the human condition: </p><ul><li><p>A finite, uncertain lifespan</p></li><li><p>Needs to be met throughout that lifespan</p></li><li><p>No payoff for sacrifices that don’t play out but also,</p></li><li><p>Discomfort for sacrifices not made</p></li></ul><p>Back to work.</p>
