<p>Pattern: someone says, “We need to go faster!!!” (yes, 3 exclamation points!)</p><p>Transformation: ask “latency or throughput”. They’ll say “both”. Keep asking until you get an answer or you learn that the organization refuses to distinguish.</p><p>Latency is the distribution of times from when work enters the system until work leaves the system. “For the features that ship, on average [ed: careful, see also Long-Tail Distributions] they take 4 months from specification to evaluation in production.”</p><p>Thoughput is the total of work items leaving the system every clock tick. “We seem to finish 14 features per month.” (Yes, features aren’t all the same size, or at least not yet.)</p><p>Depending on which you want to improve, you would rearrange the system differently.</p><p>There’s an entire discipline devoted to this kind of work, which I can’t describe in a single Thinkie. The value generated by distinguishing the goal of improvement is that in the short-run it’s impossible to improve both latency &amp; throughput, &amp; people will waste time trying. (Long term reducing variance improves both latency &amp; throughput, but it seems to take a while.)</p><p>If the team isn’t responding to change in time, it’s latency you want to improve. If the team isn’t getting enough done, it’s throughput you want to improve. If both, then you need to decide which to improve first. If leadership refuses to choose latency or throughput, then you’ll keep muddling along as is until a) someone decides or b) there’s a crisis &amp; someone decides.</p><p></p>
