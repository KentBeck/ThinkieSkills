<blockquote><p>First published March 2017. I was addressing the problem of growing remote development sites (this is when work from home wasn’t common). You open a new engineering site in, say, London. How do you structure your projects? The same dynamics apply when building a single software product, though.</p></blockquote><p>Way back when, before there were interwebs or MacBooks, we used to load all of our Macs into the back of our Volvo station wagon, pick up a whole rum cake (still warm) at the Boulder Creek Deli, and drive up to my cousin Herb Derby’s house on a Saturday. There we would wire up a temporary LAN and start playing Spaceward Ho!</p><p>Ho! was a game of exploration and conquest set in space [ed: what would now be called a 4X game]. It was full of tradeoffs: invest in better technology or more colonization, invest in better range or better firepower, long-term or short-term? Each tradeoff created risks and opportunities, depending on what the other players chose.</p><p>These game evenings went on far into the night (and sometimes the morning). At the end there was one gloating winner and a bunch of losers, but all full of cake and eager for the next battle.</p><p>I played many hours of Ho! against the fiendishly clever computer opponent, trying to refine my game play so that when the time came I could earn the coveted Last Slice.</p><p>In the end I found two reasonable strategies. I was reminded of Ho! when discussing growth strategies recently.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Thank you to my sponsor <a href="https://tuple.app/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=kent+beck+2">Tuple</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Remote pairing for fun &amp; profit</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png" width="1456" height="662" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:662,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:202988,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;friction prevents pairing, Tuple encourages it&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="friction prevents pairing, Tuple encourages it" title="friction prevents pairing, Tuple encourages it" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vFf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1a452e-f5fe-4fc0-9390-c07f2a5c71f4_2750x1250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Collaboration enhances focus.

Succession plays a part as well. When you have one successful project, how quickly do you start new projects? How do you staff them? New hires, average folks from the successful project, the best folks from the successful project?</p><p>Once a site is well established the question is moot. There are always going to be a variety of projects. Early growth, though is tricky. Diversify too soon and you risk crippling the foundational projects. Diversify too late and you slow the growth of the site.</p><h2><strong>The Strategies</strong></h2><p>Ho! contains an analogous tradeoff. Do you grow conservatively? Do you wait for each colony to become profitable before starting the next one? This lets you maintain your investment in technology for the inevitable clash with enemies. Or do you grow quickly, expecting that the eventual revenue from many colonies funding rapid technology development will make up for lack of early technology investment?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ywE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ywE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ywE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ywE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ywE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png" width="366" height="355" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2a92626-d806-4e49-913d-2666c9cba121_366x355.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:355,&quot;width&quot;:366,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:148843,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Net income goes negative when you establish a new colony.

Site building is not a zero sum game. The rest of the company is not an opponent (at least needn’t be an opponent). The part of the analogy that spoke to me, though, is that the longer you are willing to wait for the big payoff, the bigger the payoff in the end. The proviso is that you can’t wait so long for a payoff that you get shut down. (Mumble mumble Kelly Criteria mumble mumble.)</p><p>Applying this insight, I would err on the side of aggressive growth in number of projects, even at the expense of some short-term progress on existing successful projects. I would err on the side of encouraging the best engineers to seed those new projects. It’s not like the new people who come in are idiots. They are going to quickly ramp up and provide their own perspective.</p><p>I would hedge my bets on new projects by applying explore/expand/extract to keep new projects small, diverse, and rapidly iterating based on concrete feedback.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em>tl;dr early in the life of a development site, grow the portfolio of projects as fast as possible consistent with giving each project a chance of success</em></p></div>
