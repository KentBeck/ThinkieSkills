<p>It’s been 2 weeks without a chapter. What’s going on?</p><p>One week of that was vacation. I should have queued up a chapter to go out regardless. Last week I just didn’t have a thing to say.</p><p>It’s not just Tidy First?. I have a handful of pieces outlined in my head that I haven’t made progress on. I wonder what’s up with that.</p><p>One thing I haven’t been doing is morning pages. For almost 20 years it’s been my fairly consistent habit to spend a half an hour each morning free associating on paper. The rule for the exercise is that the pen never stops moving. Even if I’m just making squiggles, I keep moving the pen. Eventually I think a thought in words &amp; write, “This is so dumb. Why can’t I think of anything to write? If I was going to write I’d write about…” And away I go.</p><p>Thirty minutes of that &amp; the connection between thought &amp; word is firmly established. The critical editor is silent because he (mine’s a he) wasn’t needed. Now I can get words out.</p><p>I haven’t been writing morning pages since returning from vacation. I wonder why not? I also haven’t been taking my morning walk (90 minutes of San Francisco hills). Time to get the habits back, because those habits tend to result in writing.</p><p>No dramatic conclusion. I just haven’t been writing.</p><p>P.S. If you’ve found something helpful in the parts of Tidy First? you’ve seen so far, let me know in the comments. If you have a PR or commit that demonstrates one of the tidyings, please pass it along &amp; I’ll add you to the Learner Board.</p>
