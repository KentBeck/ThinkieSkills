<p>I got into a rhythm of publishing a chapter a week without really paying attention to the outline. I’d just pick the next unfinished chapter I felt ready to write and write it. (Sometimes I wasn’t ready, as you’ve seen, but that’s part of the process.)</p><p>Here’s the thing—we’re down to 6 chapters undrafted:</p><ul><li><p>Coupling</p></li><li><p>Infection (mechanisms of coupling)</p></li><li><p>Data?</p></li><li><p>Coupling Versus Decoupling</p></li><li><p>Cohesion</p></li><li><p>Beneficially Relating Elements</p></li></ul><p>I’m both excited &amp; a little deflated. Excited because the end is in sight. The book won’t be done just because all the drafts are finished. I’m struggling with the order of the theory chapters. It’s one of those tangled-yarn situations where everything seems to rely on everything else. I may have to slice &amp; dice a bit to create a flow.</p><p>The deflation is because there are so many important (to me, anyway) topics I won’t have covered. I knew this would happen when I split of this chunk of “software design as geek self-care” from the rest of software design. I knew it but I didn’t really internalize it. I’ll come to the end of this book with so much more to write about. More to write about than when I started, actually.</p><p>As a reminder, the next book will be about software design within the team, “software design is an exercise in human relationships” where the humans involved have similar incentives &amp; perspectives to the reader. I’m starting to get excited about this topic, getting glimpses of what I’m going to talk about.</p><p>What I wanted to say to you all (4700 subscribers, 400 paid, thank you!) is that what you’d like me to talk about is more important than what I want to talk about. Comment here or DM me. Where are you struggling with software design? Where are you frustrated that your software design skills seem to fall short? What interpersonal situations seem most fraught for you as a software designer? The more you ask, the more I can answer (&amp; the more I learn).</p><p>Thank you again for your time &amp; attention, your interaction, stories, thoughts, &amp; thank you for telling your friends.</p>
