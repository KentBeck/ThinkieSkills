<blockquote><p>First published June 2017. Apparently I was already toying with the tidying metaphor, even if I could have sworn I didn’t start using it for another 4 years. Memory is a funny thing.</p></blockquote><p>I have been tidying up server code and loving it. I’ve tidied up for thousands of hours over my career, and I have some rules for making this style of cleanup safe, fun, and efficient.</p><p>Tidying up works through a series of small, safe steps. In fact, Rule #1 is If it’s hard, don’t do it. I used to do crossword puzzles at night. If I got stuck and went to sleep, the next night those same clues were often easy. Instead of stressing about the big effects I want to create, I am better off just stopping when I encounter resistance.</p><p>Tidying up is concave [ed: this was also when I was digging in to 3X: Explore/Expand/Extract] in the sense that you have a lot more to lose by a mistake than you have to win by any individual success (more on that later). Rule #2 is Start when you’re fresh and stop when you’re tired. Get up and walk around. If I don’t come back refreshed, I’m done for the day.</p><p>Tidying up can happen in parallel with development, but only if you carefully track other changes (I messed this up with my latest diff). Rule #3 is Land each session’s work immediately (after review, natch). Unlike feature development, where it sometimes makes sense to land only when a chunk of work is done, tidying up is time based.</p><p>Tidying up requires little effort for any step, so I am willing to discard any step at the first sign of trouble. For example, Rule #4 is Two reds is a revert. If I tidy, run the tests, and encounter a failed test, then if I can fix it immediately I do. If I try to fix it and fail, I immediately revert to the last known good state.</p><p>Tidying up works even without a vision of the shiny new design. However, sometimes I want to see how things might play out, so Rule #5 is Practice. Perform a sequence of tidyings and revert. The second time will go much faster and you’ll be more familiar with which bumpy spots to avoid.</p><p>Try it. Move the declaration of a temp adjacent to its first use. Simplify a boolean expression (“return expression == True” anyone?). Extract a helper. Reduce the scope of logic or state to where it is actually used.</p><h2><strong>The Rules</strong></h2><ol><li><p>If it’s hard, don’t do it</p></li><li><p>Start when you’re fresh and stop when you’re tired</p></li><li><p>Land each session’s work immediately</p></li><li><p>Two reds is a revert</p></li><li><p>Practice</p></li></ol><h2><strong>Coda</strong></h2><p>I’ve made architectural changes strictly by tidying. I’ve extracted frameworks strictly by tidying. You can make big changes safely in this style. I think this is because, while the cost of each tidying is constant, the payoff is power-law distributed. I need both data and a model to explain this hypothesis.</p><blockquote><p>Is your business looking to juice the value they get from software development.
