<p>To celebrate my mumble mumble birthday I am offering a lifetime 30% discount on the paid portion of this newsletter. You get a weekly Thinkie (habit of creative thought), draft book chapters when I’m writing a book, and my freshest thoughts about software development &amp; life as a geek. In return I get a safe, decently sized community from which to get feedback about my thinking. Subscription revenue also buys me time and freedom to think &amp; write creatively. </p><p>I hope you’ll join us as we take software development &amp; geekiness into the future. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=486151c5&amp;utm_content=143527791&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 30% off forever&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=486151c5&amp;utm_content=143527791"><span>Get 30% off forever</span></a></p>
