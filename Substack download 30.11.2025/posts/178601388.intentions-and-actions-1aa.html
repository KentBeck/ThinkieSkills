<p>I had an amazing customer experience early in the experiments with chat-based interfaces. I had an international flight &amp; I had to move it by a day. I opened a chat with KLM, clearly got an action person, said “I want to depart a day earlier,” answered a question about which departure time I wanted (“same time”), and that was it. Magic!</p><p>I’ve gotten into the habit of dropping an idea here once and then figuring I’m done. Six months later I realize, “Oh, nobody is talking about that idea but it fits perfectly here.”</p><p>Repetition. Yes, repetition.</p><p>I was looking at Julia Evans’ excellent “<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/04/25/new-zine--how-git-works-/">How Git Works</a>” and thought, “Git is a perfect example of the separation of intentions and actions.” Oh, you missed the one time I talked about intentions &amp; actions?</p><h2>Intentions &amp; Actions</h2><p>Here’s the basic idea—I have some high-level <em>intention</em>, like, “Add a 2-day layover in Minneapolis to this trip.” To accomplish this intention I have to navigate through some sequence of <em>actions</em>.</p><ol><li><p>Open this app.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to this screen.</p></li><li><p>Press this button.</p></li><li><p>Go through this payment flow.</p></li></ol><p>Part of the magic of chat-based interfaces (when they are magic) is that intentions suffice. If there are clarifying questions required, the model asks them. The mapping from intention→action is direct and one-to-one. Remember that chat that opened this piece? No extraneous information required.</p><p>Contrast this with the usual interaction once I experience an intention:</p><ol><li><p>Which app?</p></li><li><p>Where is it located?</p></li><li><p>Just ask Siri.</p></li><li><p>Oh no not <em>that</em> app.</p></li><li><p>Navigate here.</p></li><li><p>Oh wait the settings are wrong.</p></li><li><p>I need to go to that other app first.</p></li><li><p>…</p></li></ol><p>We all, as denizens of this digital universe, have thousands &amp; thousands of actions memorized along with the navigation necessary to get to them. I can imagine a universe, instead, where intentions suffice.</p><h2>Git</h2><p>Git is a great example of the distance between intentions &amp; actions. “I want to separate the structure changes from the behavior changes, commit the structure changes first, and give both commits useful messages. Oh wait there have been changes in the meantime.”</p><p>Give this scenario to a Git maven &amp; they’ll instantly give you the sequence of actions required to achieve the desired effect. I never learned Git that well. For me, my intentions are (reasonably) clear but I don’t always have a great picture of the current state of the world, the precise desired state of the world, or the hundred actions I could take to get there from here.</p><p>Git intentions live far from actions for me.</p><p>One of the joys of the genie is being able to state my intentions—make it so the last half hour didn’t happen—and having the genie handle the actions for me. And then every once in a while it doesn’t work &amp; I’m really screwed.</p><h2>Awareness</h2><p>Think about intentions &amp; actions as you go through your day. </p><ul><li><p>Where is the distance farther than it needs to be?</p></li><li><p>Where is the mapping particularly twisty or clever?</p></li><li><p>How about sequences of actions that span multiple apps?</p></li><li><p>How many actions do you take in a day?</p></li><li><p>How much time do you spend navigating to actions?</p></li><li><p></p></li></ul>
