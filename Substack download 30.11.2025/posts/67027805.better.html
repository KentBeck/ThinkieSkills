<p>As soon as I started talking about “better” software, I got a flood of definitions of quality, each seeming to advance some agenda of the definer. (To be sure, I have my own agendas.) I’m going to take a crack here at what I mean by “quality”.</p><p>With my recently gained understanding of <a href="https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/dimensions-of-power-15ac9fa0c590">power differentials</a>, the first question is, quality <em>to whom</em>? Software serves many communities. Better for one community may mean worse for another. We have:</p><ul><li><p>Programmers</p></li><li><p>Designers</p></li><li><p>Product managers</p></li><li><p>Data scientists</p></li><li><p>Operators</p></li><li><p>Users</p></li><li><p>Purchasers</p></li><li><p>Trainers</p></li><li><p>Investors</p></li><li><p>Managers</p></li><li><p>Sponsors</p></li><li><p>Marketers</p></li><li><p>Sellers</p></li></ul><p>Even for a single community, two definitions of Better can conflict. For programmers, what’s better software for this current change may be worse software for future changes. (Tidy First? aims to reduce this conflict by making things a little better between changes.)</p><p>Between communities, the conflicts intensify. We can’t ever say “better” full stop.</p><p>My career is built on programmers writing software that is better for them in ways that align well with being better for the business. It’s an inherently selfish position. I want to work with good code &amp; I want someone to keep paying for me to work with good code. Some of the folks on the list above will be well served by this strategy, others will be asked to adapt. If the adaptation stretches them too far, the whole thing falls apart. We’re in a boat, rowing together, &amp; we cross the finish line together or not at all.</p><p>Define “quality”? Oh hell no. Not stepping into that. I know what better looks like for programmers like me. I’ll keep encouraging that &amp; looking for connections to other communities.</p>
