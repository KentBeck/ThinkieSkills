<p>After an inspiring session with @BethCodes, I’ve resumed writing on the Tidy First? book. The way it’s going to work is that paid subscribers will get complete chapters (these are generally short in my writing style) as I complete them. From time to time I will post highlights for everybody, along with reflections on the writing process.</p><p>My goals are:</p><ul><li><p>A highly-engaged community providing feedback to improve both style &amp; content.</p></li><li><p>That same community prepared to promote the book once it is widely available.</p></li><li><p>A larger community (free subscribers) gaining value &amp; spreading the word.</p></li><li><p>Incentives for me to see the whole process through.</p></li></ul><p>If you have questions or comments on this process, please post them as questions on this post.</p><p>P.S. If your company markets to geeks &amp; your marketing department is interested in a unique placement opportunity, please have them contact me about title &amp; front page sponsorships. If you’re a CTO or VP Eng &amp; you’d like me to bring your whole organization along for this ride, contact me for information about organizational subscriptions.</p>
