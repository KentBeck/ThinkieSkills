<p>So I’m going to have a place. Nine years after getting divorced &amp; pushing the reset button on my finances &amp; my emotional life, the seller accepted my offer on a house. I won’t say much about it in a vain attempt to preserve my privacy, but open a window &amp; you can hear waves. I’ve always wanted to hear waves.</p><p>I’m pretty emotional, as you might guess. I’m also right on the edge of what’s possible financially. However, I did it. With your help, you in this community. Thank you. (Also, if you need consulting, or a custom talk, or a software design workshop, I’m <em>very</em> motivated.)</p><p>Here is the letter I sent the seller. It sums up what I’m feeling.</p><div><hr></div><p>Dear Ms. XXXX,</p><p>I used to think that feeling at home by the water was something I'd only experience once. Twenty years ago, I stayed in a house on the Northern California coast. Something shifted in me when I woke up to that view. Not just the beauty—though that was breathtaking—but the way the water seemed to quiet the noise in my head. I've chased that feeling in hotels since then, but you know what? Hotels never feel like home.</p><p>Eight years ago, I walked away from a beautiful country property my ex and I had built on 20 acres in Southern Oregon. I told myself that whole chapter was closed—country living, having my own place, the dream of waking up to nature. It's funny how we convince ourselves that certain doors close forever.</p><p>But here's what I've learned: sometimes life circles back, offering second chances in forms we didn't expect.</p><p>These past eight years, I've poured myself into rebuilding—not just my business, but my sense of purpose. I've written books, given speeches, coached young people in technology. Each small act of service to my community helped me remember who I am beyond what I lost. Now, finally, I find myself able to reach for something I thought was gone forever.</p><p>Your home speaks to both the artist and the geek in me. I can already imagine how the golden hills and lush vegetation would find their way into my paintings, how the rhythm of the waves would influence the music I create in that studio. There's something about the marriage of natural beauty and creative space that makes me believe I could do my best work there.</p><p>What would happen if the next chapter of your home's story included someone who understands what it means to start over? Someone who sees not just a property, but a place to finally exhale and create?</p><p>I'm not just looking to buy a house. I'm looking to come home to myself, by the water, where I've always belonged.</p><p>With gratitude for your consideration,</p><p>Kent Beck</p>
