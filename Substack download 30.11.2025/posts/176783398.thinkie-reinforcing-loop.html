<p>Pattern: you have a bad situation &amp; it’s getting worse.</p><p>Transformation: trace the effects. Find the loop where more of the bad is causing more of the bad. Go back one or two steps in the cycle &amp; influence that effect the opposite direction.</p><p>This is one of the most exciting Thinkies for me, because it offers tremendous leverage in a seemingly-hopeless situation. As soon as I find the reinforcing loop, I have all the influence I need to start things getting better.</p><p>(The way I learned systems thinking this was called a “positive feedback loop”. Over &amp; over I found myself saying, “Not ‘positive’ in the sense of ‘good’, ‘positive’ in the sense of ‘more creates more’.” I got tired of the confusion so I started using “reinforcing loop” for a loop where more of an effect tends to create more of an effect &amp; “inhibiting loop” for a loop where more of an effect tends to create less of that effect.)</p><p></p>
