<p>“Software design is an exercise in human relationships”—that’s the motto of Tidy First? Which relationships am I talking about?</p><p>(The following is a half-baked exploration of ideas intended to get me back to writing book-quality content once I’m clearer. You’ll see the polished version in the book.)</p><p>I stunned myself when I typed the motto. What in the world does that mean? Then I got to thinking about it &amp; realized it was true, but that explaining which relationships &amp; how software design enhances/hinders them was the work of the book.</p><p>Books. Not one book. This happens every time I sit down to write a book. I think there’s no way there’s a whole book’s worth of content in this topic. Then realize there are several books’ worth. Then I cut scope. And think there’s now way there’s a whole book’s worth of content.</p><p>I’ve gone through this cycle twice with Tidy First?. The first set of relationships I want to (eventually) talk about is the relationship of geeks with non-geeks. As geeks we can make stuff. That separates us from those who can only express needs but can’t make stuff themselves. I call these groups “waiters”—those waiting for changes to the behavior of the system—and “changers”—those changing the system.</p><p>There are various power differentials between the two groups, some tilting one way, some the other. Software design is one of the activities influenced by those differentials.</p><p>Changers design software to enable future (perhaps immediate future, hence tidy first) changes. Changers do this so they can maintain their relationship with waiters. (And also because it feels good.) Without design, changes take longer &amp; longer &amp; trust erodes. So that’s the first set of relationships.</p><p>The second set of relationships served by software design are geek-to-geek. If I change an API you use, that puts a strain on our relationship. Now somebody has to do the migration work. How can I continue to make needed changes without breaking trust or becoming annoying? That’s the second set of relationships.</p><p>My relationship with myself is the third set of relationships, the one I’m focusing on in Tidy First? Geeks seem to love pain. They’ll use a slow tool or a bad API or tolerate horrible coupling for far too long. The times I’ve done this it’s started with my poor relationship with myself. I’m not worth making my job easier so I just do the hard job, over &amp; over.</p><p>That’s why the tidyings are so tiny. They are the least work you can do to make your work easier. Get in the habit of making your work easier &amp; you may find yourself making other people’s work easier &amp; <em>then</em> you may find yourself making your users’ work easier. Who knows where <em>that</em> will turn out?</p>
