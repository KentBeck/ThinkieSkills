<blockquote><p>I overused analogies in the first draft &amp; didn’t connect coupling to the Surprise Factory. Thank you all for the feedback. Here is the revised version. I hope you’ll tell me what you think. Remember, the audience is a CTO looking to improve the business outcomes of development.</p></blockquote><p>Why does software, seemingly straightforward at the outset, morph into a financial black hole as it accumulates mass? The initial development cost, while not negligible, pales in comparison to the cumulative expense of post-release changes. It's easy to say, "Well, if the programmers did a better job, we wouldn't get into this mess." Turns out that software development is subject to the same natural laws that cause hurricaines, avalanches, and (more positively) blockbuster movies.</p><h2><strong>Gears</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg" width="512" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:48924,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T9oB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4a9cb1-cc36-47c7-aeb5-703502c849c7_512x288.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Imagine a box full of gears. You want to turn a little gear. It turns on its own. Easy peasy. Yes, there's a little friction, but small gear, small effort.</p><p>Then you go to turn the little gear next to it. This gear, however, is connected. Two other gears turn too. Those gears are connected. The whole box is turning. The friction associated with the initial gear is negligible, but add all the frictions together &amp; that little gear is hard to turn.</p><p>Now what if you can't see if a gear is connected or not?</p><p>This is software. Sometimes making a small change takes small effort. Sometimes making a similar change requires huge effort, because one change propagates into 2, then 5, then 100.</p><p>Instead of meshing gear teeth, though, software propagates change through <em>_coupling_</em>. Coupling is a relationship between to parts of the software where changing one requires changing the other.</p><p>Take, for example, a tax calculation repeated several times in the code. If you want to change the tax calculation, you need to be sure to change all the places at the same time. If you miss one, you have a potentially-expensive error.</p><h2><strong>Constantine's Equivalence: A Measure of Cost</strong></h2><p>Larry Constantine's insight into the nature of software costs started by noting that most of the cost of software is in the cost of change:</p><p> <code>cost(software) ~= cost(change)</code></p><p>All the little changes don't add up to much, it is the jackpot changes that drive up the cost of software:</p><p> <code>cost(software) ~= cost(change) ~= cost(big changes)</code></p><p>Those big jackpot changes, in turn, are a result of coupling:</p><p> <code>cost(software) ~= cost(change) ~= cost(big changes) ~= cost(coupling)</code></p><p>While managing the cost of software may feel overwhelming, it reduces to managing coupling:</p><p><code> cost(software) ~= cost(coupling)</code></p><h2><strong>Managing Coupling to Control Costs</strong></h2><p>Why not get rid of coupling? First, because getting rid of coupling also costs. Second, getting rid of one form of coupling can easily introduce another form. Third, we <em>_do_</em> get rid of some of the coupling. That's what "Tidy First?" is intended to achieve--keeping your Surprise Factory happy &amp; humming.</p><p>Structure changes can remove coupling, but they require investment. The equation you're juggling is:</p><p><code> cost(software) ~= cost(coupling) + cost(decoupling)</code></p><p>The key to controlling software development costs, then, is managing coupling. By designing systems where components are loosely coupled, we can mitigate the cascade effect of changes. Loose coupling allows for parts of the system to be modified with minimal impact on others, significantly reducing the scope and, consequently, the cost of changes.</p><h2><strong>The Avalanche Effect of Coupling</strong></h2><p>One gear meshing with one other gear isn't a big problem. Twice as much friction still feels small. Same with software. What ruins the Surprise Factory isn't the small bits of coupling. What ruins the Surprise Factory is when the tenth feature in a sequence shockingly costs 100 times as much as the first nine.</p><p>These "jackpot" changes result from the same natural process that creates avalanches, hurricaines, &amp; large fortunes. A change here means 2 elements changing there. Oh, yeah, and those changes lead to 6 more. One of those leads to, oh dear, 12 more changes. And suddenly you're in the middle of a story that will be told to scare new team members for years.</p><p>This process is natural. There's no escaping coupling, just as when there is snow on a slope there are going to be avalanches. The leadership challenge is to encourage lots of tiny avalanches instead of one catastrophe. (Recall from the previous chapter we talked about how every day should see some structure changes.)</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: A Path to Efficiency</strong></h2><p>By understanding and addressing the intricacies of coupling and cohesion in software design, we can pave the way for more efficient, adaptable, and cost-effective development. This chapter has laid the foundation for appreciating the economic impact of design investment and set the stage for exploring strategies to minimize coupling, thereby controlling the hidden costs of software evolution.</p><p>Removing coupling can be challenging. You may not see how to remove it. You may not have time to remove it right now. All is not lost, though, as we see in the following chapter. Increasing cohesion, the dual of coupling, also reduces the cost of coupling &amp; can lead to future improvements.</p>
