<p>This is a process control Thinkie taking from Deming.</p><p>Trigger: A process has gone haywire for some reason.</p><p>Transformation: First decide if that reason happens repeatedly or just this once. React accordingly.</p><p>One class of mistakes comes from not paying attention to a process. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, who knows? 🤷 That test is red sometimes? Just ignore it. Doesn’t seem to hurt anything.</p><p>This leads to a process with loads of variation. You can’t count on a process with loads of variation. So you work around it. A flaky test is a common cause of variation &amp; deserves a systemic response. Let’s get rid of all the non-determinism in our tests without losing confidence in our test suite.</p><p>Now you have a more-reliable process. When you start observing &amp; stabilizing a process, it’s tempting to get in &amp; fix all the problems you find. You couldn’t see them before. Now you can. They are gumming up the works. FIX ALL THE THINGS!</p><p>No. Here’s the problem. If what broke the process will never ever happen again &amp; you go &amp; systemically fix it, you’re going to thrash, to oscillate. Random thing A happens, move the whole system over there. Random thing B happens, move it back. You end up spending all of your time moving things around in ways that won’t stabilize the process in the long run. Then maybe you get tired of not making progress &amp; you give up on having a stable process &amp; your back to the beginning of this Thinkie.</p>
