<p>Pattern: you’re stuck trying to make progress toward a goal</p><p>Transformation: try to achieve the opposite</p><p>For example, say you’re trying to optimize a user experience &amp; users refuse to cooperate. Despite your best ideas, user behavior remains unchanged. Invert the goal. What’s the largest change you can make to the experience that will result in no change in user behavior? Color? Layout? Flow? Language?</p><p>Eventually one of these experiments will fail. That is, a change will make a big difference in a surprising way.</p><p>Another example suggested by Ester Daniel Ytterbrink of Chocolate Driven Development fame is breaking code. Instead of trying to teach students how to write reliable code, give them reliable code &amp; ask them to break it in various ways. “Now introduce a fence post error”, “Now omit a null check”. Maybe even give them a test that passes now that should fail in a particular way once the error has been introduced.</p><p>The Explore phase in 3X is another example. The goal isn’t to validate that each experiment gives the desired result, it’s to invalidate the idea with the minimum effort. John Carmack gives an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCBCk4xVa0">inspiring description</a> of this technique.</p><p>Some people use the framing of “tricking” to describe Thinkies like this. “I’m going to trick my mind into making progress.” I don’t find that framing helpful. I start by assuming that the natural state of people is joyful creation. Sometimes we forget, but there are techniques (like Thinkies) that get us back to joyful creation.</p><p>Only under the influence of shame are our minds reluctant to make progress. Self-sabotage is a thing, as I know from repeated experience. That’s just not helpful for me to focus on. What can I do to let go of shame? (Or, applying Thinkie Invert the Goal, how can I fully feel all the shame, for you meta-circular nerds out there.)</p>
