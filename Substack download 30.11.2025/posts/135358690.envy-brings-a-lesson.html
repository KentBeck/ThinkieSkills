Fortunately, because I have good friends, they didn’t take on any of my emotion. Envy was my feeling, for which they had no responsibility.</p><p>I felt awkward, but that’s okay. It’s a familiar feeling for me. And sometimes I can use awkward as fuel for personal growth.</p><p>Come along as envy teaches me a lesson.</p><h2>Language of Emotions</h2><p>Karla McLaren’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3pY4OMm">The Language of Emotions</a></em> is a mainstay of my coaching practice. I read it a decade ago &amp; found it helpful in dealing with “negative” emotions. The book combines 2 messages:</p><ul><li><p>Each emotion brings a message. Learning the “code book” of emotions helps you turn the experience of the emotion into a lesson, spending no more time than necessary feeling bad.</p></li><li><p>Emotions cause problems when we either suppress them or put them on other people. Learn to decode the message each emotion brings to <em>you</em>.</p></li></ul><p>I didn’t read the whole book back then, just enough to get the main point &amp; begin applying it. It’s a long read &amp; there’s a lot there. Still, I found what I’d read helpful. I introduced the model of “emotions as messages” to any number of geeky students struggling as they experienced anger or fear or anxiety.</p><h2>Envy</h2><p>My recent experience with naked envy motivated me to read the rest of the book (synopsis to come). I’m glad I did. (I’m not sure why I wasn’t ready earlier, but there you go—so soon old, so late smart as my Pappy often said.)</p><p>When I feel envious, the book says, I am experiencing fear of loss of social standing. What does “loss of social standing” mean for me personally?</p><p>Folks assume that I must be financially independent by now. I’m not. To get free of my marriage I gave up almost all of my financial assets &amp; also accepted a substantial ongoing financial obligation in terms of alimony. Far from being financially secure, it’s like I’m in a kayak upstream of a thundering waterfall. If I stop paddling, over I go.</p><p>Five years ago I was on the precipice, paddling as hard as I could &amp; teetering on the brink. The last dollar had been garnished from my account &amp; I was waiting for a check to make it through the month.</p><p>I made it (with lots of help). Now I’m upstream &amp; around a bend. Yes, the waterfall is still there. I can hear it. Feel the mist. But I have time to think about how best to paddle. In the meantime, with the help of good friends, I’m learning how to enjoy the money I have (post for another day).</p><p>So, what happens if I stop paddling? I have to move out of my pleasant San Francisco apartment. Move somewhere cheaper. I have to stop traveling comfortably to nice places. I have to sell my guitar collection. I have to eat modestly.</p><p>Look, I know none of this is a great tragedy. My worst case scenario is pretty damn good, even by US standards. But it is still a loss, a forced change, a giving up of things I value &amp; enjoy. My relationship with my circle of friends would change.</p><p>And there it is—loss of social standing. I fear it &amp; for good reason. It’s a not-unreasonable scenario for my life.</p><h2>So?</h2><p>I got the message—I fear losing my social standing—wrapped in an unpleasant green envelope—envy. Now what?</p><p>Well, I can’t just earn enough to put me far enough upstream that I can ignore the waterfall. Not instantly, anyway. But I <em>can</em> do something I’ve been putting off—edit <em>Tidy First?</em>.</p><p>I’d forgotten how much I hate editing (another post for another day). But editing the book puts me one step closer to a royalty revenue stream, which pushes me a bit further upstream. Finishing the book unlocks additional revenue—speaking fees &amp; the Empirical Software Design workshop I mentioned. Finishing the book unblocks the next book in the series.</p><p>And so I’ve gotten to work. I have fantastic feedback from my technical reviewers. I’ve checked in the first changes to the book as a result.</p><blockquote><p>Here’s the promised workshop material. The legend Chelsea Troy &amp; I have teamed up to create an in-person, 2-day workshop for teams wanting the benefits of better design. Lots of hands-on. Lots of theory. Lots of imagining how good your software could be &amp; what you will do to get it there.</p><p>We are looking for a few teams to help us beta test the workshop. For this round of feedback we need to deliver the workshop in-person for a team of 10-20 engineers. If your organization wants stronger relationships &amp; smoother delivery, please <a href="mailto:kentlbeck@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p></blockquote>
