<p>Pattern: Someone is estimating or counting something that doesn’t matter</p><p>Transformation: Listen carefully to understand the need they are satisfying with those metrics &amp; find a way to meet that need another way</p><p>For example, how do you measure developer productivity? There are all kinds of made up numbers floating around that simply can’t matter. Take number of PRs per developer per day. Tell me what my target is &amp; I’ll hit that, regardless of my actual business progress.</p><p>What’s going on with fake precision? <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Like-State-Condition-Paperbacks-ebook/dp/B085CMNS8P/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Z4RAKTYKGURA&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1MZQ5sAdkk4QqfqJaESJNR_VdkOUBO98MNez7311EljA0uZv93EoI2Jk4KOXcC5DoVanntl-dIw_VA2rYdrtO0VV5ubOjc5820oJWDhe6aMylGWVOu59ssEvIfrkdy5Mrk7WrTvHL21o3TRC-Vo76LD3hadmNwtBUHtffrs09wv2yaTLzJIFctMcKHQngJxUv0lIWdqRv0r8kH7QDwPgpriMmBq_ROinRq5I26M29rQ.g1lFHsFz6fHbz_EngHrti6URcGh7HSM1CrKPvWjrWVk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=seeing+like+a+state&amp;qid=1736228173&amp;sprefix=seeing+like+a+%2Caps%2C199&amp;sr=8-1">Seeing Like a State</a></em> offers an explanation. States, that is central authorities, feel the need for their models of the world to be tidy. Square plots of land work great for tax assessment, not necessarily so well for actual farming.</p><p>The state is incentivized to make their models “legible”, easy to collect, easy to communicate. The state is not incentivized, at least in the short run, to pay attention to the multitude of other factors that go into creating a functioning, stable, productive system.</p><p>Rather than get frustrated that the CFO is demanding a rank ordering of developers by keystrokes per day [ed: this is a totally made up metric—don’t for the love of all that’s geeky use it], find out what question the CFO is trying to answer by making development naively legible.</p><p>A decision to allocate capital to engineering versus marketing is a legitimate question. Comparing made up numbers won’t get anyone closer to an informed answer, but there are other ways to inform the answer.</p>
