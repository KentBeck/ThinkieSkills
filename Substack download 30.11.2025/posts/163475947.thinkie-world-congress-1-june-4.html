<p>Your brilliant program committee has been preparing the first Thinkie World Congress. It will be an online-only event. The outline is:</p><ol><li><p>Introduction by yours truly</p></li><li><p>Facilitated discussion of a variety of Thinkies</p></li><li><p>Reflection on the discussion &amp; cross-fertilization of ideas</p></li><li><p>Second facilitated discussion of different Thinkies</p></li><li><p>Reflection</p></li><li><p>Cognitive scientist gives their take on Thinkies</p></li></ol><p>You see that “facilitated” part? That’s where you come in. If you sign up to be a facilitator, you will:</p><ul><li><p>Pick a Thinkie</p></li><li><p>Come up with one or more situations where your Thinkie might be applicable</p></li><li><p>Attend a facilitator’s orientation May 21st</p></li><li><p>Attend the conference &amp; facilitate</p></li></ul><p>We are looking for ~20 facilitators. Reply on this post or DM me if you’re interested. Attendance at TWC1 will be limited to 70 participants total, so facilitating is a good way of guaranteeing your spot.</p>
