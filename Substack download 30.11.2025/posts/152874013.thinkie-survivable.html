<p>Luca Delanna’s book Ergodicity spawned (or brought into focus) a bunch of Thinkies for me. This is the root.</p><p>Pattern: You are stuck making a decision.</p><p>Transformation: Ask if the negative outcome is survivable. Either:</p><ul><li><p>The negative outcome is survivable, in which case do the quickest, cheapest thing that generates value (information, time, or other resources). [ed: what are the Thinkies that generate cheap experiments?]</p></li><li><p>The negative outcome puts you out of the game permanently, in which case mitigate risks. But get moving.</p></li></ul><p>Jeff Bezos gave these options the inspiring names “Type One” and “Type Two”. “Reversible” &amp; “Irreversible” are more descriptive names. Which space you’re in completely changes how you should approach decisions.</p><p>Sometimes I’m stuck because I’m unconsciously acting like I’m making a survival decision when I’m not. Realizing that any outcome is acceptable gets me going. Sometimes I’m stuck because I’m consciously making a survival decision &amp; I’m afraid. I should be afraid but I should still get going.</p><p>I need to re-read my notes on Ergodicity and transcribe them into Thinkies. There’s some great stuff in there, like deliberately making lower level decisions into survival decisions causes the higher level decisions to become reversible. Later.</p>
