<blockquote><p>Within this process, every individual act of building is a process in which space gets differentiated. It is not a process of addition, in which preformed parts are combined to create a whole, but a process of unfolding, like the evolution of an embryo, in which the whole precedes the parts, and actually gives birth to them, by splitting.<br>  — Christopher Alexander, <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s rare to find a truly succinct declaration of what is different about a contrarian position, but here it is. In Empirical Software Design we acknowledge that software is grown, not assembled. Not only do we acknowledge the growth of software, we celebrate it. We encourage the growth of software. We take advantage of the growth of software to be of greater service to ourselves, our colleagues, our companies, &amp; society.</p><p>Assuming software grows is not as trivial as it may sound. The legible world, the world of divide &amp; conquer, doesn’t want growth. It wants to start in control &amp; stay in control. The legible world wants to start with the pieces, create them separately, then put them together.</p><p>A growing system ruins legibility. Where are the rows? Where is the grid? What pieces am I going to make? When will I be done? How much is this going to cost me? What will I get for my money?</p><p>All of these are understandable questions. They can be answered early, but they can’t be answered honestly early. Can’t be answered accurately early.</p><p></p>
