<p>You see a block of code inside a routine that has an obvious purpose &amp; limited interaction with the rest of the code in the routine. Extract it as a helper routine. Name the routine after the purpose (not how the routine works).</p><p>The refactoring-aware among you will recognize "Extract Method" in this tidying. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Executing this tidying/refactoring can be tricky without automated refactoring. That's why you should be in an environment offering automated refactorings. It's the 21st century after all.</p><p>I want to mention a couple of special cases of extracting a helper. One is when you have to change a couple of lines within a larger routine. Extract those lines as a helper, change just the lines in the helper, then, if it makes sense, inline the helper back into the calling routine. (Usually you'll find yourself growing fond of the helper &amp; keep it around).</p><pre><code>routine()
    ...stuff that stays the same...
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...stuff that needs to change...
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...stuff that stays the same...</code></pre><p>Becomes:</p><pre><code>helper()
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...stuff that needs to change...

routine()
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...stuff that stays the same...
&nbsp; &nbsp; helper()
&nbsp; &nbsp; ...stuff that stays the same...</code></pre><p>(If you've read ahead you'll recognize this as cohering, creating a cohesive element. If not, don't worry, we'll get there.)</p><p>Another case for extracting a helper is expressing temporal coupling (a() needs to be called before b()). If you see:</p><pre><code>foo.a()
foo.b()</code></pre><p>frequently, then create</p><pre><code>ab()
&nbsp; &nbsp; a()
&nbsp; &nbsp; b()</code></pre><p>Fondness is not the only reason to keep helpers around. Frequently you'll find yourself want to use your new helper hours or even minutes after you've created it. Interfaces become a thinking tool to think about problems. New interfaces emerge when we're ready to think more abstractly, to add words to our design vocabulary.</p><p>Don't worry about using the helper everywhere it might apply. Using the helper can be taken care of in another tidying. (Some tools will automatically identify &amp; modify all the places where a new helper applies. Heaven bless those tools.)</p>
