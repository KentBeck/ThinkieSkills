<p>Consider a function that looks like this:</p><blockquote><p>return …big long expression… *<br>   …another big long expression…</p></blockquote><p>Let’s say we replace it by:</p><blockquote><p>width = …big long expression…<br>height = …another big long expression…<br>return width * height</p></blockquote><p>From a refactoring perspective we have executed Extract Local Variable twice. But why?</p><p>From a Tidy First? perspective we have introduced 2 new elements, the local variables. The return statement is related to the variables by <em>using</em> them. The benefits of the relationship are:</p><ul><li><p>The return statement is shorter.</p></li><li><p>The return statement is easier to read for intent.</p></li><li><p>The 2 sub-expressions are easier to read in isolation from each other (assuming they are isolated).</p></li></ul><p>So yes we have more elements, but we also have more benefit. In this case the tradeoff seems clear. In others it will depend on, well, a whole bunch of stuff which TF? will discuss at length.</p>
