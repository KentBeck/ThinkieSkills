<p>My friend Barry died this week. We had been trying to set up a meeting to arrange a learning event in South Africa when I got a message from his wife Rina that he was in hospital. I told him I looked forward to when he was well &amp; we could talk.</p><p>Three of my many Prof Barry memories:</p><ul><li><p>Listening to stories of fighting apartheid during my first visit to SA in 2005. Everyone had their stories to tell. Barry didn’t say much but he smiled a lot. Now I know why (read <a href="https://amzn.to/3MFESxK">Coded History</a>!).</p></li><li><p>Kicking rat carcasses out of the way while touring derelict buildings near Wits University. Barry described the Tshimologong Digital Innovation Precinct that only he could see. By then I knew him well enough that I wouldn’t have bet against his vision, rats or no.</p></li><li><p>Last time we were together—walking near his house. We talked about getting older in tech, education &amp; the promise of the next generation, &amp; the social impact of technology. We ran across friends of his in the park (no surprise) &amp; downed a couple of whiskies. Got hot half way through &amp; ate a popsicle.</p></li></ul><p>Barry lived his life by principle. He felt a responsibility to non-white South Africans &amp; put his life on the line to support them. He felt a responsibility to the tech world of Africa, Cairo to Cape Town, &amp; worked to educate everyone on the continent. He loved the work of programming &amp; kept geeking.</p><p>Barry backed his principles up with effort. His effort has now ceased. Because he worked from principle, though, that effort continues in the work of students &amp; grand-students &amp; great-grand-students. Grand Geek, indeed.</p>
