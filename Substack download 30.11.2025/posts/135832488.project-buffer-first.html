<p>Pattern: You’re starting to plan a project with a fixed delivery date</p><p>Transformation: Start by saying, “How certain do we need to be about the scope &amp; date? Okay, we’ll start with 15% (or 10% or 20%) project buffer.”</p><p>This Thinkie seems to be terrifying to folks. The planning process seems like it’s supposed to be based on over-promise/under-deliver. I hate working under a cloud of failure, though. Starting with a project buffer lets the team work with the assumption of success.</p><p>Tetris projects are where you take all the available time &amp; fill it with vaguely defined &amp; uncertainly estimated features. Think about the last row of features you add. How certain are you of those decisions—the scope, cost, &amp; priority of the features?</p><p>You don’t lose any value not making those decisions today. Instead the last row is a reassuring block that says “Buffer”.</p>
