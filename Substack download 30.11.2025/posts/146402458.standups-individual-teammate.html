<p>I was asked about standup meetings the other day—</p><ul><li><p>When should they be run?</p></li><li><p>How long?</p></li><li><p>What topics?</p></li><li><p>How big a team?</p></li><li><p>What questions?</p></li></ul><h2>People</h2><p>Hang on. We’re missing the point here. What fundamental human need is met by a morning standup? Not what does the team need or the organization need or the users need. The geeks, when they meet in the morning, what’s going on?</p><p>It’s tempting to view the activities of a software development team as a kind of board full of knobs/levers/gauges. Too many bugs? Turn up the tests. Not enough responsiveness? Plan more often.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png" width="809" height="751" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:751,&quot;width&quot;:809,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:766426,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Cockpit with a million dials &amp; gauges&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Cockpit with a million dials &amp; gauges" title="Cockpit with a million dials &amp; gauges" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Vz0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99166f31-8019-4f83-8dee-ffde3c06056d_809x751.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Not Software Development</figcaption></figure></div><p>While practices do have observable effects, there is a deeper, more human &amp; humane, interpretation of the activities of software development. We aren’t engineers in a giant, insubstantial locomotive. We’re people. Dealing with people.</p><h2>Person → Teammate</h2><p>Capitalism requires code switching. From the close of business one day to the start of business the next, we are parents, spouses, musicians, writers, runners, movie critics, comedians. Then when that whistle blows in the morning, we are instantly transformed into workers &amp; teammates. Our individual goals &amp; aspirations &amp; skills are seconded to the team, to a degree &amp; for a while.</p><p>I’m not going to guess which one of these sets of roles is Bruce Banner &amp; which is The Hulk for you, but the transition between is painful. It may be the sort of pain we just get used to &amp; so pretend it doesn’t exist, but it’s still there.</p><p><em>That’s</em> what the standup meeting is there for—to give everyone a moment to say, “Oh, yeah, okay, these people &amp; their needs are going to be important to me for the next 9 hours.” Take a breath. Get to work.</p><p>Different contexts will require different approaches to this transition. If the team is co-located &amp; used to showing up at around the same time &amp; pairs switch frequently &amp; folks gather around the espresso maker most mornings, then maybe folks don’t need a ritual to manage the transition from person to worker. If the team is fully remote &amp; in different timezones &amp; just getting used to each other then likely yes, the need for ritual supporting the transition is greater (also harder because of the time shifts, which is why Mechanical Orchard teams tend to be organized by longitude).</p><p>At Gusto a group of us used to gather by the coffee machines &amp; give everyone walking to their morning coffee a giant “woo woo” &amp; an arm wave. If you’re looking for efficiency, that’s a damned efficient way to get folks out of “me” mode &amp; into “us” mode. Doesn’t look great from a bits/person/second metric but hey metrics don’t tell the whole story.</p><p>Treating standup meetings as a technical solution to a technical problem—we need to communicate this many bits of information to this many people as efficiently as possible—misses the real point. We’re people. With needs. The better those needs are met, the better we can meet the needs of others.</p>
