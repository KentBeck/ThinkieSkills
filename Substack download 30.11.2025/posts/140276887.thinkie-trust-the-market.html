<p>I’m motivated to understand the world. I grew up in a chaotic household where little made sense, hence my quest to make sense of things. However, the world can still be a damned confusing place.</p><p>Pattern: A market is acting in a confusing or irrational or unsustainable way.</p><p>Transformation: Answer the question, “What would have to be true for the market to be right &amp; me to be wrong?”</p><p>For example, the San Francisco housing market made no sense early in COVID. Rents &amp; house prices were sky high pre-COVID. Then a whole bunch of people moved out. Every block had a moving van every day, it seemed. And yet…rents &amp; house prices didn’t drop.</p><p>This contradicts my naive interpretation of markets—demand decreases, then prices decrease. What would have to be true for prices still to be accurate?</p><ul><li><p>Half of those moving vans were bringing people in to the now-vacant units.</p></li><li><p>There was so much unmet demand pre-COVID that demand still outstripped supply.</p></li><li><p>It just takes a while for markets to adjust.</p></li><li><p>There is a grand conspiracy between banks, real estate firms, &amp; government to prop up prices. (Okay, so when you reach conspiracy theories it’s time to turn back.)</p></li></ul><p>Trust the Market is a great example of a Thinkie in the sense that you don’t use it to generate good ideas, you use it to generate ideas that you will then evaluate. Sometimes markets seem irrational because they are actually irrational. You see clearly. When your group is wrong, though, you gain advantage from being the first to re-evaluate your position.</p>
