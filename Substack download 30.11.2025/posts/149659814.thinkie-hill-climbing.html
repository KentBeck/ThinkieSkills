<p>On the subject of favorite analogies:</p><p>Pattern: Something isn’t good enough but you’re stuck improving it.</p><p>Transformation: Recast the situation as hill climbing—</p><ol><li><p>Identify a fitness function for the situation. What means “better”?</p></li><li><p>Identify a threshold for the fitness function above which you’re satisfied (for the moment—nobody’s satisfied for long).</p></li><li><p>Identify the “hill” on which you are currently “climbing”. [ed: those scare quotes are a blatant clue of a metaphor being wielded in anger]</p></li><li><p>Ask if the local maximum meets the threshold.</p></li><li><p>If not, be prepared for things to get worse before they get better as you shift to a new hill.</p></li></ol><p>Say we have a system to store photos. We want to be able to search all of our photos in a second (just making up numbers here). We’ve tried various techniques to improve search performance, some of which have worked. Now we can ask, “Will these techniques, if played out, work for our whole portfolio?” If so, great, keep climbing. If not, we need to switch to a new system, necessitating the cost of export, import, &amp; the inevitable glitches.</p><p>The thing I like about Thinking Hill Climbing is that it unsticks me from my fear. At the same time, I can use that fear for long-ranging planning. What’s the next step? Take it. And the next? Take it. Then every once in a while I can roll back &amp; use Thinkie Envelope Calculation to make sure I don’t get stuck in Getting Better But Never Be Good Enough-Land.</p>
