When we moved back to the USA in 1999, the whole family lived in a trailer while we were building our house. When we moved into the house, we transferred the most important items to the house, leaving the trailer half full.</p><p>The half-full trailer remained for a couple of years until the county told us we couldn’t have 2 houses on the site. How were we going to get everything else moved out of the trailer? After all, everything remaining was less important, per definition, than the items we had moved. If we continued moving items in priority order, our motivation would continue to wane—Zeno’s Moving Out Of The Trailer Paradox.</p><p>Right now what I have to finish is drafting all the Thinkies—70 done, 25 to go. Since I’ve been using Thinkie Fun Bit to schedule which ones to write, I, again per definition, have some reason not to write every Thinkie remaining on the list.</p><p>Pattern: You’re stalled completing a long, static list of tasks.</p><p>Transformation: Start at one end of the list &amp; work through it in order.</p><p>There’s lots more to say about Thinkie One Room At A Time.</p><ul><li><p>You have a known list. This is not for getting started. Not for discovery. The Thinkie list has remained at ~100 for six months now.</p></li><li><p>Order doesn’t matter much. The first few Thinkies needed to be chosen carefully. Thinkie Obviously &amp; Thinkie Can’t Because were important to get out early because they are readily accessible. Reading them helps folks decide whether to engage with Thinkies. At this point, though, which Thinkie comes next won’t change the trajectory of Thinkies much.</p></li><li><p>The items all need to be done. There’s another Thinkie in there about drawing a line &amp; saying, “Good enough!” I still want to write up all the Thinkies because, well, it’ll feel good.</p></li></ul><p>Given those constraints, One Room At A Time is close enough to optimal not to matter &amp; it doesn’t suffer from diminishing motivation like a most-important-first sequence.</p><p>In the case of the trailer, we emptied one room of the trailer at a time. When a room was empty, we closed the door &amp; never opened it. With the Thinkies I have the list I mentioned the other day in chat. I’m just going down the list.</p>
