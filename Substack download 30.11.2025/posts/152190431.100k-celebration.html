<p>This newsletter started as a way to force er… encourage myself to write <em>Tidy First?</em>. If I had paying subscribers, my reasoning went, I would feel bad about not writing &amp; a little good about writing.</p><p>What has emerged has exceeded any of my expectations. I published the book last year. I passed 1000 paying subscribers, enabling me to quit my day job &amp; focus on writing. This month I passed 100,000 total subscribers.</p><p>And the best part is this newsletter is no longer about me. A vibrant, thoughtful, communicative community has formed to discuss where software development—software design, yes, but also process, business, AI, personal &amp; team growth—is going.</p><p>One of the benefits subscribers pay for is a weekly Thinkie, a habit of creative thought that I share once a week (see the introduction below). Thinkies have about reached critical mass, with a conference coming next year for paying subscribers &amp; a book not long after.</p><p>I’ve chosen professional pricing for my newsletter as the best tradeoff of sustainability &amp; access. However, a discount never hurts, right? So this week, get 30% off your paid subscription &amp; receive your Thinkie, draft chapters of <em>Tidy Together</em>, &amp; access to our loud, thoughtful, creative community. Expense it if you can—your employer will be receiving the benefits of your new skills &amp; perspective.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=638dca2f&amp;utm_content=152190431&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 30% off forever&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=638dca2f&amp;utm_content=152190431"><span>Get 30% off forever</span></a></p><p>Kent</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;c6abdcfa-59ba-4954-96e1-d532b1e42e72&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;“How did you think of that?” I frequently get this question.
