Trying to hold those conflicting feelings in place at the same time was uncomfortable, so I took a step back to think about my financial goals, my community goals, &amp; my own level of energy &amp; ideas.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1526358,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q0C9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0da28acc-dde5-4b10-9678-cbf3b021b03f_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I set down 4 succeeding financial milestones for this Substack:</p><ol><li><p>Predictable revenue exceeds predictable expenses. Currently I have a half-year’s cushion. However, adding my Mechanical Orchard salary &amp; my Substack revenue, I’m still short of my monthly fixed expenses. Some “extra” revenue always comes up—consulting, speaking, royalties—but I stress about what’s going to happen in the future. I don’t want to eat into my cushion. Reaching this milestone means I don’t have to worry about next month. I can treat found revenue as a treat.</p></li><li><p>Substack revenue exceeds predictable expenses. A more distant goal is to free me from the need for a salary entirely. I love what we’re doing at Mechanical Orchard &amp; look forward to being part of it for years, but I’d like the option.</p></li><li><p>Substack revenue allows accumulation. Even more distant is revenue that takes care of all predictable &amp; discretionary expenses with money left over to save.</p></li><li><p>Freedom from the need to earn. The far future is accumulating enough assets enough to not need revenue any more.</p></li></ol><p>Leading Substacks are financially successful enough to enable 3 &amp; 4.</p><p>With this in mind, I plotted my historical revenue growth. The picture makes it clear that even Milestone 1 is 3 years off. This is not a sustainable business. If I can’t do something to bend the curve up, I need to go back to treating public content as strictly a hobby. I’d rather not do that. I enjoy working this hard on content.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png" width="1456" height="478" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:478,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:128142,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Revenue growth takes 3 years even to reach my first milestone&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Revenue growth takes 3 years even to reach my first milestone" title="Revenue growth takes 3 years even to reach my first milestone" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3N_0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1920b98e-e046-4e28-9954-97e5944b851b_2630x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What a relief! I feel frustrated because I <em>should</em> feel frustrated. What I’m doing isn’t/wasn’t working for me. Great to have confirmation. But also I’m going to need to change. I need to find a steeper slope.</p><h2>Thread 2: Eric Ries</h2><p>The second thread was a <a href="https://www.lennyspodcast.com/reflections-on-a-movement-eric-ries-creator-of-the-lean-startup-methodology/">wonderful interview</a> between <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Lenny Rachitsky&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1849774,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/afba5161-65bb-4d99-8d6b-cce660917fa1_1540x1540.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;41abd7c1-a567-4973-b88d-a9e17bc609a1&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> and <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Eric Ries&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1086517,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:null,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;ca5d172d-c596-4bfb-8457-34f195be0d64&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>. I was a big fan of The Lean Startup since before it was called The Lean Startup. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIPzotGQaoM&amp;pp=ygUWa2VudCBiZWNrIGxlYW4gc3RhcnR1cA%3D%3D">keynoted</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHvfUssSWZU&amp;pp=ygUWa2VudCBiZWNrIGxlYW4gc3RhcnR1cA%3D%3D">the</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qldY0g_dI&amp;pp=ygUWa2VudCBiZWNrIGxlYW4gc3RhcnR1cA%3D%3D">conference</a>.</p><p>What I learned listening to the conversation was that I had forgotten some important points in the intervening years. Eric repeated the definition of a startup: a temporary organization in search of a sustainable business model. 💡That is exactly <em>my</em> problem—tidyfirst.substack.com is not sustainable. I could just try to write more &amp; more, but that’s unlikely to solve the underlying problem—I’m going to burn out before I reach my goals. I need to search for a sustainable model, even as I appreciate the support &amp; feedback I already receive.</p><p>Okay, so tidyfirst.substack.com is a startup, not a company. Now what?</p><h2>Thread 3: Mortality</h2><p>One more thing before we get there. The time I invest in tidyfirst.substack.com is irreplaceable. The time I waste worrying about it is also irreplaceable. This year has been filled with friends dying. Some were quick—weeks of notice. Some were slower—months of notice. Some were overnight—there one day &amp; gone the next.</p><p>My number one priority needs to be to enjoy each day. I’m not guaranteed tomorrow. Whatever change of direction I come up with, I need to enjoy it. Any “slog slowly &amp; painfully for the next 5 years” options aren’t going to work for me. I could easily be dead without enjoying any of the deferred benefits.</p><p>At the same time, I seem to have the opportunity to get to Milestone 4. I don’t want to close myself off from that.</p><h2>Startup Time</h2><p>What does treating tidyfirst.substack.com as a startup mean?</p><p>The money that comes in is welcome. Revenue buys me space &amp; time to choose what I do. Revenue also offers feedback about what parts of what I’m doing are working for you all. Finally, revenue points the way to a sustainable level of revenue (or demonstrates that sustainability is unreachable).</p><p>Where can I search for a sustainable business—more revenue, similar level of effort?</p><ul><li><p>Paying versus non-paying</p></li><li><p>Higher prices for new customers</p></li><li><p>Exploring complementary products</p></li></ul><p>I am adjusting the boundary between exclusive &amp; public content. I set out to try to reach as large an audience as possible, so I made everything as free as possible. The second order effect, though, was that the resulting financial squeeze limited my time available for writing, resulting in a smaller audience (you systems thinking alumni will recognize this).</p><p>All subscribers will get a “from the archives” post a week plus an original post about once a week. Topics will be mostly about software design &amp; software development. Paying subscribers will get the whole firehose, all the topics, all the posts—weekly Thinkies, this sort of self-reflection, ideas for products, book chapters once I start rolling on book 2, my emerging thoughts on the various topics on <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/idea-portfolio">The List</a>.</p><p>I still hate those mid-post paywall boundaries, so I won’t do that. All posts will either be public or just for paying subscribers. Even contemplating this, though, is hard for me. I’m going to want to publicize everything I write. Time to learn new skills.</p><p>To complete the picture, founding members, consulting clients, &amp; speaking clients all individually provide significant amounts of revenue. They choose the topics of our conversations &amp; we interact in real time.</p><p>When I set up this Substack I just chose the default prices. I didn’t know better so spending more time on the decision made no sense. Also, how many people would sign up anyway?</p><p>There are 2 conflicting forces operating on prices here. First is subscription fatigue. People have signed up for more than they read. I don’t want to be one of the first ones cancelled. At the same time, my $7/month price is low for my audience. I should be able to increase revenue by raising prices for new customers to match those offered by similar newsletters.</p><p>The final step towards sustainability is offering complementary products:</p><ul><li><p>Site license. What would it mean to sell a tidyfirst.substack.com license to a whole organization? What additional value would corporate clients find enticing?</p></li><li><p>Real-time tidy first workshops. I’m going to experiment with a 2-day Empirical Software Design workshop, where we go over material from all 3 books, work through exercises, discuss the experience, &amp; imagine how it might apply in practice.</p></li><li><p>Videos. So far the videos I’ve produced have clearly not been sustainable. It may be time to try again.</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The definition does say that a startup is in <em>search</em> of a sustainable business model. What if I don’t find one? First, as long as I’m enjoying the steps along the way, <em>c’est la vie</em>. Second, my fallback position isn’t horrible, even if it’s not as much fun as succeeding. Third, maybe one of my lottery tickets will pay off. Lastly, this will all be over soon so I’ll leave the last words to the great (if fictional) Dr. Sidney Freedman.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!goLH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!goLH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!goLH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!goLH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!goLH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg" width="640" height="581" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46952747-04ba-47f0-a20a-b51e45c2d64b_640x581.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:581,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;M*A*S*H \&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice.
