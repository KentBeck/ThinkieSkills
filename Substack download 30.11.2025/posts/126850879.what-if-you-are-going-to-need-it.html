<p>Back on the C3 project, Chet Hendrickson walked up to me with a design problem. “We’re going to need this so the design is going to be complicated. Oh and we’re going to need that, which complicates things further. And we’re going to need this other…”</p><p>“You aren’t going to need it.”</p><p>“But we are, and so…”</p><p>“You aren’t going to need it. What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?”</p><p>Pause. Thinking. “I could do this for now.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Away he went.</p><h2>Curse of Knowledge</h2><p>Chet’s problem wasn’t that he didn’t know enough. His problem was that he thought he had to solve an overwhelming number of problems at once. Those two mantras—”You aren’t going to need it” &amp; “What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?”—were intended as reminders that it’s okay to do an okay job today &amp; make it better tomorrow. In fact, because of the time value of money &amp; the likelihood of learning, choosing to defer a decision can create value.</p><h2>Lifeware</h2><p>I had the good fortune last week of visiting Lifeware, a Swiss-based insurance software company I have worked with for 25 years. I noticed that Lifeware solves certain problems in a more complicated way than is obviously necessary. A quarter century of experience has shown, however, that this “over” engineering is actual the simplest, most pragmatic solution to problems that most business systems choose not to solve.</p><p>The next few posts introduce you to the Lifeware business architecture. Each post highlights an element of the architecture, its goals, &amp; its consequences.</p><h2>Overall Goal</h2><p>Lifeware manages insurance contracts. It charges its customers per contract per year, so Lifeware’s sustainability depends on managing these contracts with little human intervention. However, insurance is an incredibly complex domain &amp; programming to manage all possible scenarios is impossible.</p><p>The overall goal of Lifeware’s business architecture is mostly-automated processing of contracts with computer support when humans need to intervene. After human intervention, automated processing should resume.</p><p>Lifeware &amp; its customers are served by achieving this goal. Policy holders &amp; beneficiaries also benefit. Insurance is full of opaque pricing &amp; fees. Explainable, transparent processing allows end customers to understand what they are paying for &amp; what they are getting.</p><h2>Two Timelines</h2><p>As if insurance as a domain isn’t complex enough, that complexity is multiplied by operational complexity. There are 2 timelines at work—the real world &amp; the system. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg" width="1456" height="776" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:776,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:655901,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Two address changes in the external world are immediately reflected in the system&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Two address changes in the external world are immediately reflected in the system" title="Two address changes in the external world are immediately reflected in the system" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SCek!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb15fc2fe-6b8f-4a8f-8590-c72fedd34b73_2600x1385.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>These timelines are eventually consistent.
