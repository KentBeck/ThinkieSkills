<p>I morphed this newsletter from being solely about software design to being my general blog. I feel a little bait-and-switch-ee, especially with all you paying subscribers, to offer you one thing &amp; then deliver something else. Now seems a good time to inform you about what all topics you may be seeing soon. (Use Sections to choose what posts you see.)</p><p>I’m not guaranteeing all these topics will be represented. That’s not how I engage with ideas. I have an even larger portfolio of ideas that I think of once a month. The ideas listed here are the ones where I’ve made enough progress on that I’d like to write about them (each one is at least book-sized).</p><p>I do guarantee that you’ll see frequent posts about software design. Tidy First? is almost out. Book 2 is cooking on the front burner. Posts on software design come roughly once a week.</p><p>Paying subscribers also get one Thinkie (habit of creativity) every week. See below for more details.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg" width="1456" height="2247" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2247,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1152841,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Index card listing ideas I am working on&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Index card listing ideas I am working on" title="Index card listing ideas I am working on" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1pWM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a394df0-8119-44c2-9ddf-c4d41a5a2075_2149x3317.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Ideas</h2><ul><li><p><em>Scaling XP</em>—One limitation of Extreme Programming is that it speaks to organizing the work of tens of people, not thousands. Limiting scale is an advantage because it lets XP say more about details but it’s a disadvantage because the macro environment profoundly affects development &amp; the macro environment is often severely dysfunctional (at least from a geeky perspective). What would it take to speak from principle about the work of thousands?</p></li><li><p><em>TCR: Test &amp;&amp; commit || revert</em>—TCR is an alternative to TDD that I find fun &amp; challenging. If the tests fail, the code reverts to where it was the last time they succeeded. TCR creates intense incentives to work in teensy tiny steps. I’m not sure where TCR is going because folks pooh-pooh it as impractical.</p></li><li><p><em>Limbo</em>—Speaking of the work of thousands, coordinate the work of thousands of programmers besides having everybody work in teensy tiny steps. Likewise, this is utterly impractical—until it is essential.</p></li><li><p><em>3X: Explore/Expand/Extract</em>—Software development changes radically depending on whether you are searching for a new source of value, trying to keep up with demand for a surprisingly successful source of value, or continuing with predictable growth. Not just software development—management changes, technology changes, project management, product management, marketing, sales, finance. Everything changes.</p></li><li><p><em>Thinkies</em>—Habits of creativity. Habits may seem like the opposite of creativity, but I’ve noticed that most of my ideas originate from a limited (like 40) set of habits. Each of these habits (“Thinkies”) generates an idea in a certain context. Mostly the ideas are easy to invalidate. When you fail to fail, though, the idea is likely to be valuable. Paying subscribers get a new Thinkie every week.</p></li><li><p><em>Systems Thinking</em>—Learning to see causality flowing in a system offers greater leverage with fewer unanticipated side-effects than working with simplistic, linear cause-and-effect.</p></li><li><p><em>Geek Incentives</em>—We create incentive systems all the time, often without realizing we are creating incentive systems. These systems often result in outcomes that are the opposite of what we intended. Feedback loops, reinforcing &amp; inhibiting, intensify these unexpected effects. What would it take to create aligned incentives? (e.g. performance review)</p></li><li><p><em>Tidy First?/Empirical Software Design</em>—How &amp; what to design, but even more when &amp; why. Software design as an exercise in human relationships, at all scales.</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://kentbeck.github.io/TestDesiderata/">Test Desiderata</a></em>—12 desirable properties of tests. How do they interact? Interfere? Reinforce? We’ve only explored a tiny fraction of this space.</p></li><li><p><em>Coaching</em>—I’ve spent many thousands of hours coaching thousands of students, including coaching coaches. I may be ready to talk about it.</p></li><li><p><em>Sponsoring Software</em>—What can an executive or customer of software development do to encourage success from their perspective? Lots, it turns out. There are also some classic mistakes to avoid.</p></li><li><p><em>Tradeoff Thinking</em>—One of my most prolific Thinkies is recasting a situation as a tradeoff space. A dozen tricks suffice to make tradeoff thinking a powerful way to think.</p></li></ul><h2>Others</h2><p>That’s not everything going on in my brain. I’m thinking about politics, climate, health care, mortality, the future of creator economics. I’m making art. I’m writing stories. Playing poker. Singing &amp; playing guitar. The list above, though, is what you’re likely to see me write about here.</p>
