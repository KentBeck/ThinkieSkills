<p>One of my early questions about ChatGPT was, “Will it have a positive second derivative?” Will the use of ChatGPT accelerate the rate at which ChatGPT improves?</p><div

Improvement?</figcaption></figure></div><p>This is a useful question to ask of any new technology. If a technology has a positive second derivative, it’s going to be bigger than one’s intuition expects. Microprocessors ran simulators for designing faster microprocessors. The faster microprocessors got, the better the simulators, &amp; the faster microprocessors got faster. Our brains just aren’t wired to predict the effect of such double reinforcing loops.</p><p>Eventually all technologies run into inhibiting loops, where the better they get the harder it becomes to get better. The tug-of-war between the reinforcing loop &amp; the inhibiting loop makes for interesting viewing.</p><h2>ChatGPT &amp; Kids</h2><p>ChatGPT is already showing signs of inhibiting loops. It’s noticeably worse at complicated coding tasks than it was a year ago. I wouldn’t have expected regression, but here we are.</p><p>Copilot is a candidate for the second derivative. As Copilot improves it makes it easier for the Copilot developers to improve Copilot. I wasn’t (&amp; am not) convinced that this effect is large. It’d be interesting to peer into Copilot development to measure this effect.</p><p>Yesterday I found a definite case of positive second derivative. As you may have heard, I am developing Project Rent-a-Kent, a language model tuned with everything I’ve ever written about software development. Many of you here have tried an earlier version, a blog post companion intended to answer questions about my posts here.</p><p>I’ve never been the greatest natural programmer. On my senior practicum project I was the third best out of the five of us. My shortcomings are why I had to develop all the habits I write about—to make up for my inability to handle loads of complexity. One of those habits is taking a step back &amp; analyzing the whole situation before resuming action.</p><p>So I had Rent-a-Kent. It gave noticeably better answers than stock ChatGPT (better by my standards, which are what folks pay me for). How would we improve further?</p><p>Rather than just blindly try one of the 100 or so experiments we’ve identified, I thought of analyzing the questions we’d gotten so far. Ordinarily I’d pick up a pack of index cards, write the questions on them, then sort them spatially on a big table. Alternatively I might start a mind map &amp; see how the questions cluster. Either exercise would take several hours of uninterrupted concentration. I kept stalling.</p><p>You probably see where this is going. I took all thousand questions we’ve answered so far &amp; fed them into ChatGPT, asking for the general categories into which they cluster. Back came a pretty good, but wordy, answer. So I fed the same query into Rent-a-Kent. Back came a much better answer (appended to this post).</p><h2>Lessons</h2><p>You hold a shovel in a gold field by applying this same principle. I’m not saying the exercise above is so amazing, I’m saying that you can try similar ideas with unpredictably enormous upside. This moment didn’t happen at random for me, though. I prepared for it.</p><ul><li><p>Started using ChatGPT.</p></li><li><p>Tried a bunch of crazy ideas with it, like the Test Desiderata Rap (not coming to a music video near you any time soon).</p></li><li><p>Accelerated my use by wiring ChatGPT to the Action button on my iPhone. I wanted to emphasize “…using ChatGPT” in my potential solution space.</p></li><li><p>Built &amp; tested Rent-a-Kent with the good folks at Incubyte &amp; my new friend Ivan Tolkunov.</p></li></ul><p>So, build that ChatGPT muscle &amp; exercise it to improve your own work. Inspiration will come. Who knows how far that will take you?</p><p>P.S. If ChatGPT could solve Python dependencies, then I’d be <em>truly</em> impressed.</p><div><hr></div><p>The question categories, according to Rent-a-Kent:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Personal and General Inquiries</strong>: These questions are either about personal identities (like "what's your name?") or general, non-technical topics (e.g., "what is the weather like today?"). They are more conversational in nature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Software Engineering and Design Principles</strong>: This category includes questions about software engineering concepts, practices, and principles. It encompasses topics like Test-Driven Development (TDD), software architecture, and design patterns (e.g., "what is TDD?", "What do you think of software architecture?").</p></li><li><p><strong>Productivity and Performance Measurement in Software Engineering</strong>: These questions focus on the measurement of productivity and performance in a software development context. They include queries about how to measure developer productivity, the impact of certain practices on productivity, and related challenges (e.g., "how do I measure programmers' productivity?", "Can you give examples of counterproductive behaviors that arise from misguided productivity measurements?").</p></li><li><p><strong>Specific Technical Issues and Solutions in Software Development</strong>: This group involves more specific and technical software development challenges, such as dealing with dependencies in TypeScript, managing large codebases, and the practicalities of implementing certain methodologies (e.g., "I have a relatively large TypeScript codebase and I have the following conundrum...").</p></li><li><p><strong>Philosophical and Conceptual Discussions about Software Development</strong>: These questions delve into deeper, often philosophical or conceptual discussions about software development. They explore the rationale behind certain practices, the implications of various methodologies, and the broader impact of technology in the field (e.g., "why should I worry about measuring productivity?", "What is the point of the blog post?").</p></li></ol><p></p>
