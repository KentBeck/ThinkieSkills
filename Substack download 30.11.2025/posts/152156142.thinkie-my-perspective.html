<p>Pattern: you’re having trouble communicating with someone.</p><p>Transformation: invite them to look at the situation from your perspective.</p><p>I know, I know. This is the opposite of the usual advice to look at the situation from the other person’s perspective. It’s a Thinkie. It generates ideas, not good ideas.</p><p>I’ve used this when evaluating investment opportunities. The entrepreneur is telling me all about their cool technology, what amazing uses people will put it to. I’m not convinced.</p><p>I could just say “no” at this point. Thinkie My Perspective says instead to offer them my point of view, to give them a chance to speak more persuasively. “Here’s how it looks to me. I have enough capital to make 2 more investments. I have 8 candidates. I need to see some concrete path to revenue before I can say yes. Tell me that story—how are you going to earn revenue?”</p><p>[I suppose there must also be a Thinkie Your Position where you restate what you’ve heard them say without judgement as preparation for evaluation.]</p>
