I would be incentivized to write because I wanted to retain &amp; attract subscribers. Subscribers would be incentivized to join/continue because they were getting value all along.</p><p>One of the themes of Geek Incentives is that all incentive systems have misalignment &amp; unintended consequences, so I shouldn’t have been surprised that the Tidy First? book incentives also contain misalignment &amp; unintended consequences. To paraphrase Monty Python, though, no one intends unintended consequences. Here’s the dilemma:</p><p>I came back from a 3-week poker vacation ready to write. Yesterday I wrote a useful chapter on batching tidyings into pull requests. This morning I was getting fired up to write a follow-up chapter on the rhythm of tidying when I felt a tug to slow down. What’s going on?</p><p>What was happening is that I both want more subscribers (through attraction &amp; retention) &amp; I want to hang on to those subscribers longer. I generally try to publish a chapter a week. If I publish chapters on succeeding days, I don’t guess I’ll attract more subscribers but I will hang on to those subscribers for a shorter period.</p><p>I have a counteracting intrinsic incentive, which is to get the damn book done so I can get on to the next book. The topic, software design, has naturally split into 3 books based on scope: individual, development team, whole team. I’m eager to get the trilogy finished.</p><p>And so I have incentives tugging me every which way. That is part of the nature of incentive systems. If we want to understand incentives <em>as a system</em>, we must add together all the vectors of influence (to be geeky about it) to find the net effect of the system. Then adjust. Always adjust.</p>
