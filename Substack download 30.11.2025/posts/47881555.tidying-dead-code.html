<p>Delete it. That's all. If the code doesn't get executed, delete it.</p><p></p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Deleting dead code can feel mighty strange. After all, someone took the time and effort to write it. The organization paid for it. There it is. All somebody has to do to make it valuable is to call it again. If we need it again we'll be sad we deleted it.<br>I'll leave it as an exercise for you, tidy reader, to identify all the cognitive biases I just demonstrated.</p><p>Sometimes it's easy to identify dead code. Sometimes, for example because of extensive use of reflection, it's not so easy. If you suspect code isn't used, pre-tidy it by logging its use. Put the pre-tidying into production &amp; wait until you're confident.</p><p>"But what if we need it later?" That's what version control is for. We aren't really deleting anything. We just don't have to look at it right now. If (and this is a long string of conditionals) we 1) have a lot of code that 2) isn't used right now that 3) we want to use in the future 4) in exactly the same way it was originally written &amp; 5) it still works then yes, we can get it back. Or we can just write it over better. But worse comes to worse, we can always get it back.</p><p>As always, delete a little code in each tidying diff. That way if it turns out you were wrong it will be relatively easy to revert the change (see also Reversibility). "A little" is a cognitive measure, not a lines-of-code measure. It could be one clause in a conditional (e.g. you see the condition reduces to true), one routine, one file, one directory.</p>
