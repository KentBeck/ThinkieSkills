<p>I think in terms of patterns, <em>a la</em> Christopher Alexander. Ever think, “I’ve made exactly this decision before”? That’s a pattern. Making one decision leads to others, which also invoke <em>déjà vu</em>. Patterns form a lattice. Higher level decisions lead to lower level implementation decisions. That’s a pattern language.</p><p>When all the material I’d poured into my head about motivation, leadership, and ethics started to crystallize, out came a pattern language. These are the decisions folks make all the time, but mostly by copying. I wish people would take explicit note of the tradeoffs.</p><p>I expect each of the patterns below will turn into a 2-3 page essay. I also expect to find half again as many patterns by the time my exploration is over. Put it all together and it forms a short book. But I won’t get ahead of myself. The list below will give you a hint of where my thinking is leading.</p><h3>Mission</h3><p>How do you align the efforts of disparate groups?</p><p>Speak to the heart first and not the head. Pathos and logos.</p><p>Fuzzy enough for everyone to attach to. Specific enough that you can call out deviance.</p><p>Express the company’s shared purpose as a single phrase, both emotionally evocative and accountable.</p><h3>Process</h3><p>How do you align the efforts of disparate groups?</p><p>Specify a process that all efforts will use.</p><p>E.g. Proctor &amp; Gamble, where new product development and introduction is a widely shared and understood process. People find unity in sharing the process. It speaks less to the heart but it is scalable and teachable.</p><h3>Levels</h3><h3>Private Levels</h3><h3>Public Levels</h3><h3>Many Levels</h3><h3>Few Levels</h3><h3>Compensation</h3><h3>Equity</h3><h3>Cash</h3><h3>Salary</h3><h3>Bonus</h3><h3>Objectives</h3><h3>Key Results</h3><h3>Individual Attribution</h3><h3>Shared Attribution</h3><h3>Computed Salary</h3><h3>Negotiated Raise</h3><h3>Competing Offer</h3><h3>Raise Pool</h3><h3>Salary Band</h3><h3>Fixed Salary</h3><h3>Feedback</h3><h3>Synchronous Feedback</h3><h3>On-demand Feedback</h3>
