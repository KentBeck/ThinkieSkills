Then I realized—I just turned 63! What more excuse do I need?</p><p>I appreciate the support I receive from my current subscribers. They give me time, space, &amp; feedback as I help geeks feel safe in the world. They have inspired me to expand my writing ambitions. <em>The Surprise Factory: A Tidy First Executive Briefing</em> would never have happened without paying subscribers, who have been receiving chapters as I draft (and, grrrrr 😡, edit them).</p><p>Paying subscribers also get a Thinkie a week. Thinkies are habits of creative thought, little engines you hold in your head to churn out ideas. You’ll invalidate most of the ideas thus generated, but when you get a good one—yee haw! I’ve been publishing one a week &amp; will continue to do so for at least the next year. Turns out there’s a lot going on in my head.</p><p>Here are the pieces delivered to paying subscribers in the last month:</p><ul><li><p>Thinkie: Reduce Utilization</p></li><li><p>Thinkie: Reduce Variance</p></li><li><p>Thinkie: Grow *Then* Split</p></li><li><p>Thinkie: Upside/Downside</p></li><li><p>Thinkie: Envelope Calculation</p></li><li><p>Thinkie: Shift Left &amp; Right</p></li><li><p>Surprise Factory--Coupling: Why Software Costs So Damn Much</p></li><li><p>Features &amp; Design: A Dance of Contrasts</p></li><li><p>Features &amp; Design: Both Essential &amp; Yet Mutually Exclusive [ed: I had to rewrite this chapter based on feedback]</p></li></ul><p>If you want to see writing like this, please sign up this week. Coming soon is book 2 of the Empirical Software Design series. Paying subscribers don’t have to wait to read chapters as I draft them.</p><p>(If you lose this email, I’ll send one more reminder the day the offer is set to expire. If you miss this offer I’ll probably do another towards the end of the year.)</p>
