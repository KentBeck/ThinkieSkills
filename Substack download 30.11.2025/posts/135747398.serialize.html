<p>The next section of Thinkies relate to project management. Taylorism has gifted us a set of dysfunctional assumptions about projects. Since these assumptions are mostly unspoken, it takes relatively little effort to come up with better ideas. (See Mary Parker Follett <em>Dynamic Administration</em> for an antidote.)</p><p>Pattern: the team is doing things in parallel</p><p>Transformation: perform the same tasks serially</p><p>Example: the team is implementing 2 features at the same time. Have the whole team work on one feature, ship it, then work on the next feature.</p><p>Here is where the limitations of the Thinkie format emerge. I could easily go on for hours or days about why this Thinkie “works”, when it works, its limitations, examples, &amp; counter-examples.</p><p>For Thinkie purposes I’m just going to ignore all that. I’m going to assume that you are an intelligent, responsible adult. When you note the pattern you’ll apply the transformation &amp; then you’ll <em>evaluate</em> the result. I’ve said it before—Thinkies are good for generating <em>lots</em> of ideas, not lots of good ideas.</p><p>Whether serializing activities will result in improvement or a disaster is up to you to figure out. The Thinkie has done its job as soon as it has suggested an experiment.</p><p>Don’t serialize everything. <em>Consider</em> serializing something that is currently done in parallel where the parallel tasks have unexpected interference.</p>
