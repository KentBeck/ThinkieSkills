<p>I’ll write a more thorough version of this for public consumption, but given the pace of change around augmented coding I wanted to share a technique I may have found. That is, I found the technique, but I’m not sure how widely applicable it is. I hope you’ll help me find out.</p><p>Here’s the problem: you’re solving a complex problem in a complex language. The compounding complexity is too much for the genie to handle. You’re stuck. What do you do?</p><p>I was facing exactly this problem. I wanted to implement a B+ Tree (you can look it up or I’ll describe it in the public post). It has some fairly hairy operations with lots of edge cases. Oh, and I was implementing it in Rust, which I don’t know well.</p><p>We got a ways together, my genie &amp; I, but eventually just got stuck. The genie would make a change &amp; break something else (it also can’t seem to get the idea of always running all the tests because they take like 20ms, but that’s a struggle for another day).</p><p>I got fed up &amp; decided to start over in Python. No more worrying about complicated ownership rules that kept getting in the way of what seemed to me to be perfectly ordinary design decisions. Indeed, we made fast progress (enough so that I’m also working on a C extension to make the Python version competitive with existing library data structures).</p><p>Development wasn’t easy. I had to guide the genie into an unusual use of recursion, but once it was on track it got to understandable code &amp; comprehensive tests.</p><h2>Plagiarize, Plagiarize</h2><p>Since I was ready to give up on the Rust code (for the third time, if you’ve looked at my GitHub) I thought what the hell, let’s try something different.</p><p>Hey Genie, says I, erase the current Rust implementation &amp; reimplement it, one test at a time, by transliterating what you see in Python into Rust. For giggles, I did this using Augment Code’s new Remote Agent, so I had even less control over the genie’s path than usual.</p><h2>It Worked!</h2><p>The resulting code:</p><ul><li><p>Shorter</p></li><li><p>Better tests</p></li><li><p>Better coverage of edge cases</p></li><li><p>More idiomatic Rust.</p></li></ul><p>Try it. The next time you get stuck in complex language X, try in simpler language Y &amp; tell the genie to plagiarize!</p>
