<p>Pattern: You are choosing between 2 or more options &amp; you don’t have the information needed to choose wisely yet.</p><p>Transformation: Implement some of them all until one is clearly superior.</p><p>I’m running into this right now with a personal project—a server-grade implementation of Smalltalk. Should I implement the virtual machine as a bytecode interpreter or an abstract syntax tree interpreter? Should I use Go, Rust, C++, or JavaScript?</p><p>I really don’t want to waste time on an implementation I end up throwing away. This is a personal project, with no chance of commercial payoff. However, it’s been a long time since I worked at this level so ignorance is abundant.</p><p>And so I’m trying most of the combinations. Now, it helps that I’m augmented coding. The genie makes rapid progress possible on several fronts (almost) simultaneously.</p><p>What if implementing them all is too expensive? Thinkie Compared To What. Thinkie Fun Bit/Easy Bit. Or, yeah, sometimes you can only afford one roll of the dice.</p><p>The effort on the (eventually) doomed variants is not dead weight loss. I’m writing code &amp; tests in one variant that are useful in others. I’m learning lessons I can apply. Progress on one variant encourages me to work on others.</p><p>¿Por qué no los dos?</p>
