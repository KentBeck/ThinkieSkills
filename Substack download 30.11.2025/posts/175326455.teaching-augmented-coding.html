I’ve been joined by a business partner (hi <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alyssa Eidam&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:10296543,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f23b780-7798-48d4-9f0d-dafd7a3e8c5c_1808x2458.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;ce45624b-6ef7-43ac-a7f3-257839099e9e&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> 👋🏻) who is doing a great job of simultaneously increasing my moneyoptions while keeping my freetime stable (for more see <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/how-i-will-measure-my-life">How I Will Measure My Life</a>).

The experience I wanted to offer followed from this sequence:</p><ol><li><p>Junior programmer—you don’t know what would be cool to implement.</p></li><li><p>Senior programmer—you can imagine lots of cool things to implement.</p></li><li><p>Principal programmer—you know how hard things are to implement so you progressively shrink the box of “things worth working on”.</p></li></ol><p>Along comes the genie &amp; the box of “things worth working on” just got bigger. Much bigger. The experience I want participants to have is, “Ohhhhh! I see. This &amp; this &amp; this that I’d given up on suddenly became worthwhile again!” As I put it after the workshop, I want to see the whites all around your eyes when you get it.</p><p>(Turns out many of those projects are still prohibitively expensive to implement, but that’s a story for another day. For one day it’s enough to wash the scales from folks’ eyes.)</p><p>I held this inaugural augmented coding workshop with my long-time friends at <a href="http://iterate.no">Iterate</a>. We had about 30 participants, 20 external &amp; 10 Iterate employees. My workshop schedule is to layout the time we have together, list the topics we could cover, then dive in.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg" width="768" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:768,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:209667,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://tidyfirst.substack.com/i/175326455?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VA00!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53eeceef-41f3-4fc3-aed6-4862c3b6fe70_768x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Going in my biggest worry was what to tell participants about prompting. I don’t have enough experience to have a set of rules or patterns. Besides, any glimmering of a pattern I had a month ago is already obsolete. But what to tell them?</p><p>I settled on “nothing”. If you have no idea what to do, any impulse is equally good (disasters excluded). And it worked.</p><p>I asked participants to pair &amp; most did. I told them to pick their project. All did. I told them to play &amp; learn. All did.</p><p>That was the theme of the workshop—play &amp; learn. “What will happen if we…” “Try it!” “But…” “Try it!!!”</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you’re teaching augmented coding, I recommend leaving prompting alone. Nobody knows so everybody should be trying &amp; sharing (that’s what we did at the breaks). Certainly provide structure. Talk about testing. Talk about the mechanics, things like agent.md. But give the programmers the chance to program &amp; soon you’ll be seeing the whites of their eyes.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Interested in a live demonstration of augmented coding for your organizations or executives?</em></p><div class="directMessage button" data-attrs="{&quot;userId&quot;:24333739,&quot;userName&quot;:&quot;Kent Beck&quot;,&quot;canDm&quot;:null,&quot;dmUpgradeOptions&quot;:null,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}" data-component-name="DirectMessageToDOM"></div>
