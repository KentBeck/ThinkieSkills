<p>“I have to be the smartest person in the room!” I blurted this out &amp; my girlfriend and her friend cracked up. “What? What?”</p><p>It took me a few months but I finally got it. I was conflating “smart” with “safe”. Trying to be “smartest” is impossible. You don’t know who else is there. But I have a fair amount of control over “safe”, whether I’m “smartest” (whatever that means) or not.</p><p>What does this have to do with poker? I was reflecting on my emotional reaction to losing. I don’t care about the money. I make sure of that. But sometimes walking out of a losing session I burst into tears. (This leads to some awkward Lyft rides.)</p><p>I have been unconsciously linking winning with smartest with safety. If someone outplays me, I panic. (Aren’t emotions wonderful?)</p><p>Last session I deliberately turned my thinking to skills. I have some poker skills. Other players have some skills. Sometimes, in a certain situation, my skills prevail. Sometimes their’s prevail. And then there’s a whole dose of variance. </p><p>I found this settling. My identity isn’t under threat, regardless of how the session goes. I have my skills. The more of them I exercise the better. The more skills I gain off the felt the better. And both of those are under my control. I don’t even care if I’m the smartest person at the table. Thanks, Susan. </p>
