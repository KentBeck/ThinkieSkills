<p>Pattern: You are doing something for the nth time. Should you do it in a predictably good way or a new way?</p><p>Transformation: Kinda flip a coin (more details below).</p><p>The Thinkies format has settled down lately after a fair amount of thrash early on. That’s fairly common for me. I’ll try lots of variations early in the life of an idea until I find one I like. Then I’ll periodically shake things up.</p><p>The challenge is that we have 2 mutually exclusive competing incentives—do things in a known-efficient way or find better ways to do things. Finding a new way to, say, explain a Thinkie takes longer than just explaining it in the old way. It takes longer &amp; it might end up being worse.</p><p>There’s value in doing stuff &amp; there’s value in finding better ways to do stuff. Somehow you have to choose if this is one of those “doing” situations or one of the “finding (maybe) better ways” situations. Too much of either &amp; you end up getting less done that you would otherwise.</p><p>Turns out there’s an algorithm for flipping the coin mentioned above. It goes back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Multi-Armed Bandit Problem</a>. You’re faced with 2 slot machines. Each has a different payoff, one more profitable than the other. You don’t know which is which. You have a bucket of quarters. Which machine should you put the next quarter into to maximize your profit.</p><p>What if at first you get lucky with the less profitable slot machine. You conclude that’s the better machine &amp; end up putting your quarters in the wrong machine. You can’t “conclude”, you can only hypothesize based on what you’ve seen so far.</p><p>The optimal algorithm goes like this—based on the payoffs you’ve seen so far you form a model of each machine. You simulate the payoff from each machine. Whichever one performs best in the simulation is the one you put the actual quarter into. You use the actual results to update that machine’s model.</p><p>The first quarter is totally random. That’s okay because you don’t have any information. You are investing the quarter to create information. Once you have the information, you make slightly better decisions. After a while you’ll mostly put quarters into the more profitable machine. Every once in a while, though, you’ll try the other machine, in case you’ve got it wrong.</p><p>The way I use this insight is that when I’m giving a presentation on a topic, new or old, I mentally flip a coin. Will I present the old way or will I try to find a new order of presentation, a new metaphor, a new tone? Me being me, I often choose the new way, because I always believe there is a better explanation out there. But sometimes I just want to use Old Reliable.</p>
