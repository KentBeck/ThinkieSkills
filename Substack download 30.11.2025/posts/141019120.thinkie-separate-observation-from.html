With the list in hand, judge the situation.</p><p>Say I’m getting feedback face-to-face with my boss. I don’t like what they are saying. I start to feel defensive. Rather than let that feeling generate more, stronger feelings I instead list to myself the observable facts about what is happening:</p><ul><li><p>They are leaning forward.</p></li><li><p>When they began talking about me their voice rose in pitch &amp; volume.</p></li><li><p>They said I had been late twice last week.</p></li><li><p>They said they couldn’t rely on me.</p></li><li><p>My shoulders are hunched up to my ears.</p></li></ul><p>These are all things that someone reviewing a videotape of the encounter could observe.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Now I can decide how I want to respond. I’m less likely to get into one of those “feelings generate feelings” loops. I’m more likely to have compassion for them &amp; to set sensible boundaries.</p>
