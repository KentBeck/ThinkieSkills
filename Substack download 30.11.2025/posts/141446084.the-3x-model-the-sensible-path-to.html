This model serves as a lens through which we can view the lifecycle of software projects and answer the burning question: How did we end up in this mess?</p><p>I came up with this model after 5 years (starting 2011) at Facebook trying to understand how Facebook could simultaneously:</p><ul><li><p>Operate reliably</p></li><li><p>Scale unprecedentedly</p></li><li><p>Innovate</p></li></ul><p>Most companies have trouble doing one of these things, much less two. I’d never seen all three before.</p><p>One secret ingredient was (implicitly) recognizing which category a project or product was in, recognizing shifts between the phases, &amp; managing the project or product completely differently depending on the predominant risk.</p><h2><strong>Explore: The Birth of Innovation</strong></h2><p>In the Explore phase, software development is a series of rapid, low-cost experiments. Teams are in search mode, seeking the right product-market fit. The aim here is not perfection but discovery. Decisions are made quickly, and shortcuts are often taken to test ideas in the real world. This phase is marked by excitement, creativity, and a fair amount of chaos. It’s like jamming in a garage band, where the goal is to come up with something new and exciting, not to produce a polished studio album.</p><h2><strong>Expand: Scaling Up Under Pressure</strong></h2><p>One of those crazy experiments pays off as none have before. The rules of the game all shift. We no longer risk irrelevance, we risk not being able to scale.</p><p>The Expand phase is characterized by rapid growth and the urgency to capture market share. It’s a high-stakes environment where avoiding existential threats becomes the priority. Shortcuts and quick fixes continue, justified by the need for speed. It’s like the band’s first big concert - you need to perform, and the pressure is immense.</p><h2><strong>Extract: The Trap in Success</strong></h2><p>Eventually the existential pressure of challenges fades. New challenges emerge. Now that the product has scale, the focus shifts to sustainability, reducing costs, and increasing revenue. However, the shortcuts taken in the Explore and Expand phases begin to show their true colors. The codebase has become a labyrinth of quick fixes and patchworks, leading to high maintenance costs and reduced optionality.</p><p>In this phase, the once-agile project starts resembling a clunky, old machine that’s hard to maintain and even harder to innovate. It’s like the band stuck playing their old hits, unable to compose new music because they’re bogged down by their past.</p><h2><strong>The Consequences: High Costs and Lost Opportunities</strong></h2><p>The biggest problem in the Extract phase is not just the inflated costs, but the loss of optionality. The rigidity of the codebase prevents the team from adapting to new opportunities, acting as a barrier to innovation. It’s a classic case of short-term gains leading to long-term pains.</p><p>Here is where Facebook’s genius at the time shone. Rather than treat every project as a high-risk, bet-the-farm endeavor, Facebook spun out a stream of further low-risk Explorations, each treated with the Explore rules. When one of them blew up, Expand rules took over, resulting in an edifice of big successes built from bricks of small failures.</p><h2><strong>The Executive’s Role: Steering the Ship</strong></h2><p>Which phase is your project or product in? Software design as we talk about it is primarily an Extract phenomenon. Better design lets you run more efficiently, but it also enable the safe experimentation on which future growth depends.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Path Forward</strong></h2><p>When to shortcuts &amp; leap forward &amp; when to invest for the long-term? Executives have more perspective on where projects are than those in the thick of execution. They can help place teams on the curve &amp; make the difficult transitions from one phase to the next.</p><p>We don’t invest in software design just for fun. We invest in software design to make money. In the next chapter, we’ll dig into the economic drivers of software development.</p>
