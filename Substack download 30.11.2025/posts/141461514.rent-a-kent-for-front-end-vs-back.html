<p>We’ve prepared a model to answer your questions &amp; comments about today’s post, Front-End Versus Back-End (almost wrote “Beck-End”, which is a little ominous). <a href="https://rentakent.onrender.com/p/front-end-versus-back-end">Ask away here</a>.</p><p>We’ve been experimenting with various base models &amp; various ways of personalizing them to give you at least a bit of that patented Kent Beck experience. Let me know if you find an answer particularly good or bad. Also lmk if you have any followup ideas. Also lmk if you’ve tried RAK before &amp; it’s getting better or worse.</p><p>This LLM stuff is like programming a computer whose instructions keep changing their definitions. Fun. Leveraged if you guess right. Frustrating.</p>
