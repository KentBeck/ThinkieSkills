<p>I’m not quite ready to start writing the management section, so I thought I’d ramble a bit here and listen to the feedback from y’all.</p><p>You’ve read (and practiced applying, remember the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PiynrFItJd1ULYVfhxHrq5aarCnOOR8-GoKSlbUCh6A/edit?usp=sharing">LearnerBoard</a>?) the tidyings. Being good at the mechanics lowers the risk that you won’t tidy &amp; increases the chance that you’ll stay safe. That’s really the first principle, stay safe. Sometimes I’ll tidy 2-3 times just for practice if what I’m doing doesn’t feel quite safe.</p><p>So, stay safe. If tidying ever breaks stuff, you’ll be tempted not to tidy, to go back to “my wizard-like powers enable me to change this messy code”.</p><p>How do you stay safe? Work in small slices. One tidying per PR isn’t a bad policy (assuming you still have PRs for tidying, we’ll get to that). “But what if getting a PR approved takes days/weeks?” Then that’s a problem to solve, not a valid reason to work un-safely.</p><p>Another topic is sequences. The tidyings stand in relation to each other. Until we have data from actual use, I can speculate on which tidyings tend to lead to which others. Explaining Variable tends to lead to Explaining Helper. Chunk Statements (should this be called “Explaining White Space?”) tends to lead to Explaining Helper or Explaining Comment. And so on.</p><p>At some point its probably a good idea to map all the tidyings and how/when/why they lead to each other. I’ll do this eventually if one of you don’t.</p><p>Another principle is maintaining the option to switch. That is, it’s valuable to be able to say, “Okay, this is enough tidying for now. I’m going back to changing behavior &amp; I’ll get back to tidying later (or not).” If you maintain safety &amp; keep tidying changes small, you automatically get the option to switch.</p><p>There’s the whole topic of timing. When do you tidy first? Tidy after? Tidy just because.</p><p>There’s the equally important topic of stopping. When do you stop tidying? When do you stop tidying first? After? Because? Refactoring got a bad reputation in part because programmers didn’t know when to stop. “We need 6 months of refactoring before we can add any new behavior.” “You’re fired.” It doesn’t have to be this way, but TF? better address the issue.</p><p>There’s the whole topic of incentives. Tidying is intended to be self-care, so much of the incentives are going to be internal. Tech leads &amp; managers can create incentives either encouraging or discouraging tidying. What are common ways those with power accidentally influence tidying?</p><p>How about territory? How do you handle it when someone tidies “your” code? When you need to tidy “someone else’s” code? (The early results from the LearnerBoard are encouraging—OSS projects are accepting tidying PRs, although this may be survivorship bias. Remember your PR needn’t be accept to go on the LearnerBoard.)</p><p>That’s all I can think of at the moment. Other management-ish tidying-related topics?</p>
