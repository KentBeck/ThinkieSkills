<p>One of the hardest parts of writing a book like TF? is coming up with all the examples. I’d like to do them all myself, of course, but then it struck me—why don’t I turn them into a game for y’all? So, here’s the deal:</p><p>You go find a spot in an open source projects where a tidying applies. You submit a tiny tidying PR. It gets accepted. You send me the URL of the PR (I’ll need some kind of system for this eventually). We have some kind of leaderboard of who has submitted examples of which tidyings, who has submitted the most this month/all time. When the book is published your name is listed as a Certified Tidier (except no actual certificates except maybe we’ll see). Maybe there is special recognition for folks who have Tidied Them All (submitted an example of all tidyings). Maybe that entitles you to buy the custom leather jacket with the metallic embroidered “TFMF” logo on the back.</p><p>You know, that marketing stuff. Except also really useful to you as a reader to make sure you’re engaged &amp; applying what you read.</p><p>I don’t want to make this such a big deal that anyone is tempted to cheat, but it needs to be just a big enough deal that it creates incentives for you to engage (see also geekincentives.substack.com). So don’t cheat. Tidy to make code easier to change. One example per tidying per customer, please.</p><p>We’ll prototype this first. Send me examples of one or both of the first 2 tidyings, Dead Code or Guard Clause. We’ll see how it goes. If nobody submits I’ll have my answer. If people submit but what they submit isn’t actually an example, then I need to fix my writing. If everybody submits &amp; fruitful conversation ensues well wouldn’t that be great!</p>
