<p>I once talked to a technically-oriented CEO who said that when they started they were determined to only write good code. By the time they were wildly successful, their code was the same ball of mud as everybody else. “Maybe the 2 states of a system are ‘disaster’ &amp; ‘almost disaster’.”</p><p>I know that self-reflection is out of fashion at the moment, but I gotta start by saying that maybe I’m wrong about all this. Maybe, in the larger scheme of things, software design doesn’t really matter, or only matters in rare instances. Maybe doing a better job of designing software makes no more money (or even less money).</p><p>We certainly seem to have plentiful evidence of teams seeming to invest:</p><ul><li><p>Too little, too late, or</p></li><li><p>Too much, too soon</p></li></ul><p>by the standards of Empirical Software Design and still supporting viable businesses.</p><h2>Nevertheless</h2><p>I’m going to continue to act like good design matters, because:</p><ul><li><p>It feels good to improve a design.</p></li><li><p>A good design serves our teammates (&amp; our future selves).</p></li><li><p>At the margin, a good design makes features viable that would have otherwise been uneconomic, enabling us to better serve our customers.</p></li></ul><h2>For Example</h2><p>Here are some specific moments when I <em>think</em> that software design matters:</p><ul><li><p>Testability. A better-designed interface is easier to test against. A better-designed implementation makes it easier to decouple tests from the structure of the code.</p></li><li><p>Confidence. Lower coupling &amp; higher cohesion give you greater confidence that you have made behavior changes successfully.</p></li><li><p>Teamwork. Improving design, done well (the subject of book 2), makes teammates’ jobs easier.</p></li><li><p>Pride. Programming is a job both of emotional energy &amp; intellectual insight. Improving a design feels satisfying. You see how things could be better. You make it so. Ahhhhh…</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m spending some of my remaining seconds on the planet talking about software design because it is a puzzle. What are the basic forces? How can we resolve them? How do those forces interact with our human strengths &amp; weaknesses.</p><p>I study software design because it is indeed a puzzle, a highly-technical exercise in human relationships. We’ll see if that really matters in the long run.</p>
