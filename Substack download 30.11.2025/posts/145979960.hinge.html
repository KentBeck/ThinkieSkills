<blockquote><p>This isn’t a full chapter, more of a sketch. I found myself talking about “hinges” frequently but realized I hadn’t written about it. Does anyone know the origin of the word as applied to software design? I’m pretty sure it’s not one of mine.</p></blockquote><p>MCETMEC. Make the Change Easy Then Make the Easy Change. I came up with this phrase during a coaching session with a student changing some gnarly C code. We had to change 4 places in one file at once (hey, at least it was only one file). After they started to edit the first place I said stop, backup, what would this code need to look like for it to be easy to change? Well, we would need this repeated expression to be encapsulated in a helper function. Okay, let’s make the change easy then make the easy change.</p><p>There’s a saying in aviation—the superior pilot demonstrates superior judgement to avoid having the demonstrate superior skill. The above is the same principle as applied to programming. The superior programmer demonstrates superior design to avoid having to demonstrate superior programming skill.</p><p>A helper function intended to turn a scattered change into a concentrated change is a “hinge”. A hinge is a design element that simplifies change. A function can be a hinge. Dependency injection can be a hinge—passing different classes as a parameter can make changing behavior simple. Configuration files can be a hinge—a new configuration element can make a class of changes easier.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, hinges decouple the design with respect to a certain kind of change. One side of the hinge can remain fixed while the other side changes. Long-term this tends to pay off further because if we change the code in one way we are more likely to change it in similar ways in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and for reference, the whole phrase is: for each hard change, first make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change.</p>
