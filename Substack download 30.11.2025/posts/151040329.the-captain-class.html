The book started as a classic bar bet—what was the greatest sports team of all time. He surveyed teams in the past hundred years who were outrageously more successful than their peers. Looking at these teams, he was struck that each and every one of them had a string of success that precisely mirrored the tenure of a captain. These captains, in turn, shared traits (some of which we don’t always associate with leadership). The traits are:</p><ul><li><p>Doggedness. Captains just keep coming. Their example causes the rest of the team to raise their effort level to match.</p></li><li><p>Edges. Captains play right to the edge of the rules. (This is why he says Derek Jeter didn’t see many World Series trophies–too law-abiding.)</p></li><li><p>Carrying water. Captains do the dirty work nobody else wants to do. Many are not the most skilled player. Even if they are (like Tim Duncan), they don’t show their skills unless it is necessary.</p></li><li><p>Communicate. Captains communicate with everyone on the team. Sometimes this is vocal, sometimes eye contact, sometimes physical contact.</p></li><li><p>Displays. Captains make gestures for the team to see, like committing a hard foul.</p></li><li><p>Uncomfortable truths. Captains communicate things no one else dares communicate, in whatever way, in whatever medium necessary.</p></li><li><p>Regulate emotions. Captains play with emotion but they know how and when to keep a lid on it.</p></li></ul><p>As I was reading I thought about how many of these traits organizations actively encourage and reward, how many they are prepared to recognize as impact. As organizations move into “it takes a team” scale they need to encourage (or at least not discourage) behavior that creates great teams. Teams can be good without a captain who displays all these qualities. Great teamwork, though, requires the strongest glue.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Paying subscribers fund the writing in Tidy First?

My Score</strong></h2><p>I also, as is my habit, rated myself as I was reading. Here’s how I see me: doggedness: C, edges: A-, carrying water: B+, communicate: B-, displays: A, uncomfortable truth: A for effort and C for execution, regulate emotions: B. </p><p>I’d appreciate feedback if you see me differently.</p><blockquote><p>In the 7 years since I graded myself, I would say that my communication skills have improved as has my execution of telling uncomfortable truths. Regulating my own emotions has also improved. Again, I’d appreciate informed feedback.</p></blockquote>
