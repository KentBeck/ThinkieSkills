<p>Hypervigilance adapts one to living in an abusive situation. In that situation hypervigilance makes one (marginally) safer. Hypervigilance becomes a habit, though, a habit of guessing &amp; second guessing everything around. But then what happens when you’re not in that situation any more?</p><p>I used this phrase the other day, “They are living far behind their eyes,” &amp; realized I didn’t have a good explanation of it. I know what I mean when I say it, but that doesn’t mean anyone else know what I mean.</p><p>There is a look to the eyes of someone who is living securely in the present. Their eyelids are open. Saccades<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> move at normal speeds. Shoulders are back &amp; relaxed. Neck upright.</p><p>(Can you tell I had to learn body language from a book? But I also had to learn that listing all my observations creeps people out.)</p><p>Compare that to someone whose eyelids are half shut. Crinkled wrinkles around the perimeter of the eyes. Muscles to either side of the nose half tensed. Saccades bounce around like popcorn in a pan. The head is held completely still, held forward &amp; down.</p><p>This second person is “living far behind their eyes”. They are evaluating and re-evaluating everything they take in. Is that a threat? Is this a setup for a future threat? Where is this leading? What else is coming into view? Is that a threat? What is leaving? Is that becoming a threat elsewhere?</p><p>Living far behind my eyes is exhausting. I envy (&amp; sometimes achieve) that greater presence of taking everything around me at face value &amp; feeling confident that I can handle whatever so I needn’t second- and third- and fourth-guess everything.</p><p>Also, talking to someone who is living far behind their eyes requires different rhythm &amp; presentation than talking to someone who is present. Become aware of the threat level they are experiencing. Give frequent breaks to process. Offer indirect posture—don’t square your shoulders or hips with them.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p></p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Coordinated eye movements.
