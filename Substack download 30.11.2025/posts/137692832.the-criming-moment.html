It’s frequent enough in San Francisco that we call the shattered aftermath “San Francisco Snow”.)</p><p>I got into a <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1704873897647321363">back-and-forth with SF Supervisor Dean Preston</a> about government responses to car damage &amp; theft. His contention is that the way to reduce vandalism &amp; theft is to teach tourists not to leave valuables in their cars. His argument strikes me as absurd, nonsense, a non-sequitur. Plenty of break-ins involve locals’ cars in residential &amp; commercial districts.</p><p>Rather than point fingers or shout “neener neener”, I wanted to take a step back &amp; ask what an effective response to this particular crime would look like.</p><h2>Careful…</h2><p>Most citizens have given up reporting car break-ins. The police will not investigate (for various reasons). The courts will not convict (again, various reasons). No restitution will be paid. I don’t trust police report numbers as an accurate measure of the problem.</p><p>Some folks say, “Just enforce the laws.” That won’t work. Even if I wave a magic wand &amp; every bipper is instantly arrested:</p><ul><li><p>The courts can’t handle the load.</p></li><li><p>The prisons can’t handle the load.</p></li><li><p>Long-term, the offenders will commit more crime, not less.</p></li></ul><p>None of the simple solutions is going to reduce this or any other crime (or homelessness or drug addiction). Crime results from individuals acting within a system. If the system doesn’t change, the behavior won’t change. But the behavior needs to change.</p><h2>The Criming Moment</h2><p>Bipping will diminish when potential criminals decide not to smash windows. Do something else instead. How might that happen?</p><ul><li><p>Too costly. For example, if cars used while bipping were seized, that would increase the cost.</p></li><li><p>Too dangerous. I’ve heard plenty of stories of frustrated citizens taking punishment into their own hands. However, vigilantism escalates violence.</p></li><li><p>Not lucrative enough. What if items once stolen can’t be turned into cash because fences have been put out of business?</p></li><li><p>Socially ostracized. Currently, bipping gives offenders a status boost in some communities. If instead bipping lowered status for offenders, they would be less likely to offend.</p></li><li><p>Locked up. If all the potential criminals are in prison, they can’t commit crimes. (This is one of those “simple” solutions.) Mass incarceration perpetuates racism &amp; won’t stop the next generation of offenders.</p></li><li><p>Better crimes available. I’m not advocating for this, just noticing that if mugging or kidnapping were more lucrative &amp; just as safe, folks might stop bipping. No bueno.</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We all occupy this magical spit of land together. Everyone wants more hope &amp; less fear. More joy &amp; less sorrow. Crime pushes us away from our shared goals.</p><p>Excusing offenders doesn’t help. Only when they choose to do something other than offend will offenses diminish.</p><p>Ignoring the system in which offending seems like the best option also doesn’t help. Influencing systems requires taking a look at various factors, going up-stream of the moment of offense for interventions, staying aware of unintended consequences, &amp; ignoring simple fixes that won’t help.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems like voters don’t consider these factors when electing officials. As electors we need to do a better job of selecting people who work thoughtful for the public good.</p><p>In the meantime, I’d like to see some skin in the game. Mr. Preston, park your car on the street. Send out an update every time it’s vandalized. I dare you.</p><p></p>
