Work Backwards is the essence of TDD. It’s User Stories—these are the stories we want to be able to tell about our system. It’s Shining City On A Hill (Thinkie soon to come).</p><p>I think Work Backwards works by limiting the available options. I was stuck recently while working on Tidy Together?. I was trying to describe the importance of responsibility. There’s just so much I could say, so many ways to approach the explanation. Every time I would start on one, I would be overwhelmed by thoughts of the other things I “should” be saying.</p><p>Work Backwards—what do we want our work relationships to be like? There.
