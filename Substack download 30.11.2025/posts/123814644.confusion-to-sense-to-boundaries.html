<p>[Editorial note: the data is in. Paid subscribers don’t like seeing archival content. More original writing to come.]</p><p>I’m lucky enough to be in Paris this week. Among other activities, Jessica Kerr &amp; I gave our <em>Invitation to Systems Thinking</em> workshop. One element of workshops I love is how new themes emerge. If I find myself using the same new phrase several times during a workshop, it’s time to explore it more deeply.</p><p>Our motto for the workshop is, “You aren’t in control, neither are you helpless.” You shouldn’t expect to control a complex system—too many factors, too many competing feedback loops (doesn’t stop folks from trying, but that’s a topic for another day). Even though you aren’t in control of the systems you participate in, you do have influence. Understanding systems offers a way out of passivity &amp; despair.</p><p>As part of the preparation for the workshop, I finally listed my personal goals for studying systems:</p><h2>Making some sense of the system</h2><p>Complex systems often seem random at first. Seemingly-irrelevant changes to the inputs result in massive changes to the outputs. Seemingly-obvious improvements lead to degradation. Systems thinking helps me go from “I’ll never understand this” to “Okay here are some of the parts &amp; how they might connect”.</p><p>For me this is both an intellectual &amp; an emotional transformation. I go from, “Forget about it—every improvement only makes things worse” to a sense of curiosity &amp; agency—”Well if that’s true then changing this should change that”. I have questions to explore. Hypotheses to test. Experiments to run. And energy to explore, test, &amp; experiment.</p><h2>Boundaries</h2><p>Once I’ve gotten off my butt by starting to understand a system, the second goal for my systems thinking is to clarify what I can &amp; can’t expect to influence. I want to focus my efforts on activities with a chance of payoff. For example, when the Agile/Certification Industrial Complex got rolling, I figured there was no way for me to effectively intervene. There was just too much money, too many people, &amp; too many needs being (seemingly) filled for me to make a difference. I called it out when I had the chance but I didn’t expect any change.</p><p>In addition to gaining a sense of how much I can expect to influence a system &amp; in what directions, I also want to get a sense for how long the changes are likely to take. Timing in systems is tricky. </p><blockquote><p>"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen"—<strong>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>I can still have a sense of whether we are talking about weeks or decades. An expected timeline helps me focus my efforts &amp; refocus them when they aren’t yielding fruit.</p><h2>Leverage</h2><blockquote><p>Vince Walker: You’re an ambitious man.<br>Mahatma Gandhi: I hope not.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve lived my life in hopes of making a big difference. I don’t recommend it as a way to live, as it comes with some big downsides, but it’s how I’m wired so I’m going to roll with it.</p><p>At the same time I’ve never had formal power or money (although power &amp; money are surprisingly helpless in the face of a system of sufficient complexity). If I want to cause big changes, I need leverage. Systems thinking helps me identify leverage points.</p><p>My favorite moment in systems thinking is discovering a reinforcing (positive feedback) loop. Especially if it is causing problems. “Everything we do makes the problem worse!” Excellent!</p><p>Once you have a reinforcing loop in focus, you automatically have a list of candidates places to intervene. If you can get the loop operating in the direction you want, the loop will take care of the rest.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This is what systems thinking does for me:</p><ol><li><p>Move from confusion &amp; apathy to curiosity &amp; energy.</p></li><li><p>Focus my efforts on changes that might help.</p></li><li><p>Find leverage points where small changes to the inputs may produce large, desirable changes to the outputs.</p></li></ol>
