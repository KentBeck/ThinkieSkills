<p>Recapping, Paul Graham wrote a post about how a naive interpretation of the conventional advice to Founder CEOs doesn’t work—hiring experts as direct reports, delegating all responsibility to these experts, only communicating with them, &amp; then lo &amp; behold, it all falls apart. Here’s the money quote:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground</p></div><p>In a false dichotomy, he urges the opposite—Founder CEOs (the clothing line practically designs itself) get their hands into every decision. They should assume that they know better than the experts.</p><h2>Maybe So</h2><p>First, the Founder CEO may actually be right &amp; the experts may be wrong. After all, the startup has created a new context. If it hadn’t created a new context it wouldn’t have survived this long. The Founder CEO has observed that context more carefully than anyone else. If the new context changes the rules of the game, then maybe marketing, or sales, or manufacturing, or engineering, or design, or distribution really is a new game.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Usually when everyone around you disagrees with you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken. But this is one of the rare exceptions.</p></div><p>Leaders of rapidly expanding companies should consider the possibility that they are right &amp; the experts are wrong. They should also consider the possibility that the experts are right &amp; that they themselves are wrong. Or that together everyone needs to invent something new.</p><p>You needn’t pretend omniscience to lead with confidence.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Second, Paul claims that he’s describing a new &amp; only dimly understood phenomenon. Wrong. Hewlett &amp; Packard encouraged management by wandering around 70 years ago.</p><p>It’s not that we don’t know about chordal connections &amp; escaping local maxima. We know about them. They were just messy &amp; chaotic &amp; so people who wanted easily-drawn diagrams replaced them with this tidy, legible communication structure. </p><div class="pullquote"><p>break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company only via his or her direct reports</p></div><p>No shit, Sherlock.</p><h2>Attitude</h2><p>My last critique (for now) is the attitude of the piece. </p><div class="pullquote"><p>C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world</p></div><p>Really? You’ve taken a world-class expert, put them in a new context, they make mistakes as they are learning, &amp; your best description of them is “liar”?</p><p>I’ve certainly seen folks, world-class experts, go into a new context, mask anxiety &amp; lack of self-esteem with hubris, &amp; try to run exactly their old playbook. That trick never works. Don’t do that.</p><p>But that’s also a failure of leadership, Founder CEO. Why wasn’t it safe for the expert to admit their struggles with the new context? Why didn’t you roll back &amp; have conversations about the new principles as you see them? You’d both learn something.</p><h2>Delegation</h2><p>Okay, one more. Paul characterizes delegation as:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up to them to figure out how.</p></div><p>Um, that’s not delegation. Back to Commander’s Intent:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>The desired end-state, not the method</p></div><p>The desired end-state is <em>not</em> “what to do”. It’s where you want to end up. And that’s harder to articulate than what you think needs to be done. Boo hoo. You’re the Founder CEO. You have your own clothing line, for goodness sake. Dig in.</p><p>And if, from time to time, you have to intervene in “what to do” to preserve your company, do it. But:</p><ul><li><p>That’s the exception.</p></li><li><p>Repair the relationships damaged by doing so to preserve your organization’s capacity to make future decisions.</p></li><li><p>Make a note to learn &amp; teach so you won’t have to intervene next time.</p></li></ul><p>There! Now I can enjoy the rest of my weekend.</p>
