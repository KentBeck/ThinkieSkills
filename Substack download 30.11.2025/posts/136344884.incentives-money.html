<p>When I started thinking about Geek Incentives I conflated incentives with money. How could you use money in less-disruptive ways than it was used currently? It took me a while to realize I had to back way up.</p><p>One inspiration for this wider view of incentives was economist Russ Roberts, host of <a href="https://www.econtalk.org/">EconTalk</a>. One of the central themes of economics is “incentives matter”. Adam Smith in <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> says, “<em><strong>Man</strong></em>&nbsp;naturally&nbsp;<em><strong>desires</strong></em>, not only to be&nbsp;<em><strong>loved</strong></em>, but to be&nbsp;<em><strong>lovely</strong></em>.”</p><p>“Incentive” then is any influence causing us to change marginal behavior. Yes, it can be money, but it can also be entirely intrinsic, like the satisfaction of a job well done, or it can be social, like recognition and belonging.</p><p>More, much more, about this topic in the coming weeks and months. But we ain’t talking about money.</p>
