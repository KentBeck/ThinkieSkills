<p>McDonald’s is part of the series of Decision Thinkies.</p><p>Trigger: You sense that a group may be ready to make a decision but is stalling.</p><p>Transformation: You propose a bad-but-not-ludicrous alternative.</p><p>This one’s called “McDonald’s” because the classic situation is going out to eat. Where are we going? Oh I don’t know. How about McDonald’s? Oh hell no, let’s go to XXX.</p><p>This Thinkie is related to Naivety (will write about this one soon). Ideally the sub-par decision you propose would be acceptable if the group chose it.</p><p>[ed: here is an earlier publication from Jon Bell https://jonbell.medium.com/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d]</p>
