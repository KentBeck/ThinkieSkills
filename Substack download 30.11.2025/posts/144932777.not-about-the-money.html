<blockquote><p>What follows includes frank discussion of my personal finances as a nearing-retirement person under difficult constraints in 2024 America. If such discussion bothers you, scroll, as the kids say these days, on.</p></blockquote><p><em>Tidy First?</em> has done very well for a technical book. I’ve gotten great feedback from people who found value in its discussion of optionality &amp; cohesion &amp; structure/behavior. Yes, there were some complaints about how short the book was, but we’ve discussed my plan here from time to time so you know that was both expected &amp; I don’t take it personally.</p><p>With all that, I was stalling on getting started writing book 2. And I wasn’t sure why I wasn’t writing. I knew what I wanted to say. It took a long walk on Montara Beach to help me come to grips with what was holding me back.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2204674,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rBzn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9256107-55f0-41d8-909a-ee2a71e6c869.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Summary: money.</p><h2>Tidy Together?</h2><p>Here’s the thing—I stress about money every day. I check my Stripe dashboard multiple times a day, my bank balances at least daily.</p><p>I start each month behind. How am I going to make up the predictable difference? Some months I catch up, once in a while I more than catch up (again, thank you!), sometimes I fall behind. The times I put money out of my mind for a few months, those months I definitely fall behind.</p><p>Because most of my expenses are fixed, I really can’t afford to fall behind.

I’ll always have a bed, food, shelter. But I’d rather stay adulting independently as long as I can manage it.</p><p>What does all this have to do with writing Tidy Together? Those 2 good months of O’Reilly revenue had me hoping that book royalties would contribute to financial security. Then the revenue slowed &amp; I got discouraged. I guess writing wasn’t going to help me not have to worry after all.</p><p>The long walk on the beach was the moment I surrendered to this reality. Why else was I writing?</p><ul><li><p>To really learn &amp; understand the topic of software design.</p></li><li><p>As a service to geeks.</p></li><li><p>To find &amp; build community around superior software design &amp; see how much further we could push it.</p></li></ul><p>That was it. Were those reasons good enough for me to write? Oh hell yes. And so I started writing (as you’ve seen). I was trying to use money to motivate myself to write. A part of me knew that the money wasn’t there. Predictable outcome—no writing. I accepted that I’m still contributing to causes I care about—writing.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m not asking for pity. My situation is the result of my choices &amp; actions. I’ve made &amp; lost 2 small fortunes, one to taxes &amp; the other to divorce. I publish here because I’m trying to understand myself &amp; sometimes geeks find my self-examination helpful. I’m not the only one facing a similar situation.</p><p>I live a good life. I’m frugal but I don’t deprive myself. It wouldn’t help. I have 6 months of cushion in the bank &amp; another year’s worth in my 401K. My Gusto stock, should it ever become liquid, will give me another ~2 year’s worth of cushion. It’s not a whole retirement. Barring a big exit, that’s out of reach. Even owning a house is out of reach. That’s my situation. </p><p>In 30 years none of this will matter a single fart. In the meantime I have a book to write. I can’t wait.</p>
