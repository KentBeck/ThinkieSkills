<p>Pattern: Someone asks you for information that makes no sense.</p><p>Transformation: Ask, “What’s the real question?”</p><p>Fred George suggested Thinkie The Real Question after reading Thinkie Legibility. It’s another way to get to the actual issue.</p><p>Here’s the thing, though. Sometimes people don’t want to get to the real issue. They know their fears are absurd, maybe. Or they’re ashamed of the real issue. Or maybe they don’t know what the real issue is &amp; so they’re fishing.</p><p>Asking, “What’s the real question?” works best in an ongoing relationship. Don’t build relationships at work just because they enhance productivity at difficult moments. Build relationships because it’s good to build relationships. But then lean on them at difficult moments.</p><p>“I know you asked me to rank all the programmers based on how many keystrokes they type per minute [ed: I wish this was such an absurd example that no one would ever ask this, but…]. It seems to me that you’re trying to get at something deeper. What’s really going on?”</p><p>The other person may not answer with the real question. That’s too bad but it’s understandable. You can’t force them. I can tell you this, though. The more emotional the response to “What’s the real question?”, the more likely it is that there’s something important remaining concealed.</p><p>“Just give me the goddamn numbers!” may not sound like an invitation to deeper human connection, but it can turn out to be if you stay with the conversation. Whether your best next step is to give them the goddamn numbers or to stand your ground or to tell a story I can’t tell you. But there’s something valuable there.</p><p>The other outcome of Thinkie The Real Question is that you learn something about why the information requested actually makes sense. Then your bond with the other person is stronger &amp; you know more.</p>
