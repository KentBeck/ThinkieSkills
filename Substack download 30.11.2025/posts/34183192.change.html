<p>The cost of software is dominated by the cost to change it. Successful software inspires change, for decades if you’re lucky. Was the cost before first production even 1% of the total cost?</p><blockquote><p>cost(total) = cost(initial) + cost(change)<br>  and cost(initial) &lt;&lt; cost(change)</p></blockquote><p>(All the equations here are subject to net present value, but we intend to inform intuition here not automate any decisions.)</p><p>The cost of change combines the costs to:</p><ul><li><p>Understand the current behavior</p></li><li><p>Modify the behavior without accidentally breaking anything</p></li><li><p>Validate that the whole will work as expected in production</p></li><li><p>Deploy the new version</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>cost(change) = cost(understand) + cost(modify) + cost(validate) + cost(deploy)</p></blockquote><p>We can drive down the cost of validation with automated testing. Similar with the cost of deployment.</p><p>We design software, then, to reduce the cost to understand the behavior of the current system and safely modify that behavior.</p><p></p><p></p>
