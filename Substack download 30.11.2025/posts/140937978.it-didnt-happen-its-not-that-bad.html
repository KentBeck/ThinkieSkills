<p>Several times I’ve had the experience of hearing a friend describe a new acquaintance, saying, “I dunno. Sounds sketchy,” &amp; having them come back later &amp; say, “How did you know?” Here’s how I knew (or at least suspected).</p><p>You know how control freaks are described as being “charming” at first? That’s not all that’s consistent about control freaks. They aren’t the least bit creative. The playbook is fixed.</p><p>Thinkie-style, I look for the common patterns. If I see one of them, I transform my opinion of that person. Once I see one of the patterns, I’m going to keep my distance unless I see strong evidence that the person is actually safe.</p><p>The first pattern is, “It didn’t happen.” One of my first girlfriends post-divorce tripped this pattern. “What did you mean when you said XXX?” “I didn’t say that.” Yeah, actually, you did say it. 30 seconds ago. That was the end of that relationship.</p><p>The second pattern is, “It wasn’t that bad.” “When you said XXX I felt hurt.” “Suck it up, buttercup. People say stuff like that all the time.” Now yes, I can be overly sensitive sometimes. I’ll doublecheck myself in situations like this. Maybe I don’t need to feel this hurt in the future. But “it wasn’t that bad” is a setup for me to silently accept worse behavior next time.</p><p>The third pattern is, “It’s your fault anyway.” “I don’t like it when you criticize me in front of your friends.” “That’s because you’re just too sensitive.” Yeah, no.</p><p>Those charming control freaks? They are going to trip one of these patterns, even in the midst of being charming as hell. If I hear the pattern, I’m going to set my boundaries &amp; keep my distance.</p><p>How do I know this? Because I’m a recovering control freak. I thought those thoughts &amp; said those things. I had to learn to spot them coming &amp; head them off. Sometimes now I don’t even think those things. I also invited people into my life who thought &amp; talked that way &amp; I didn’t see anything wrong with that, not for decades.</p><p>Look, I don’t expect people to be perfect. I know there is a range from “comfortable but slightly annoying sometimes” all the way to “will steal your life &amp; grind it into shit”. I want to hang out with folks on the “slightly annoying sometimes” end of the spectrum.</p>
