Perhaps it’s because, in the absence of competition &amp; high interest rates, software development tends to be so damn profitable. You could stick to the oldies: put the geeks in a room, lock the door, slide pizza in once a day, and out would come a money machine. That was never the optimal style, but who cares about optimal when you can make money with almost no effort?</p><p>The empirical style of software design I advocate here begins with human, economic, &amp; technical principles. Software design is an exercise in human relationships. But let’s start with the money, since it doesn’t matter how human or technical we try to be if we can’t create economically sustainable businesses.</p><h2><strong>Survival: The Prime Directive</strong></h2><p>During the Explore and Expand phases, your goal is survival. Get aloft, stay aloft. For software teams, this means making decisions that ensure the project lives to see another day. These decisions are often characterized by rapid iterations and a focus on immediate market needs. While they may not always be the most cost-effective in the long term, they are crucial for giving the project a long term.</p><p>Software design during Explore is "just enough to perform the next experiment". After some experience, you may notice that the design hinders experiment. Design just enough to accelerate further experiments. This inevitably leaves tons of good design ideas on the cutting room floor. Until your product sustains itself, none of those ideas matter.</p><p>Software design during Expand is "just enough to overcome the next bottleneck". You have growth enough to attract capital &amp; you’re still relatively small, so you care about survival &amp; not return on investment. Getting through to the Extract phase will offer plenty of resources to atone for the sins committed in order to get there.</p><p>Software design during Extract is still focused on survival, but the goal is to extend survival as long as possible. The design will be a mess, because the only software with clean design is software no one uses. Now you have time &amp; money to invest in design. The improvement benefits will pay off for decades. Software design can also enable safe experimentation for the next round of exploration.</p><h2><strong>Net Present Value (NPV): Sooner Money is The Same as More Money</strong></h2><p>As we move beyond survival, the concept of Net Present Value (NPV) becomes an economic driver. NPV teaches us a fundamental truth: earning sooner is the same as earning more, and spending later is equivalent to spending less. This principle is particularly resonant in the Expand and early Extract phases, where the focus shifts to optimizing the balance between immediate gains and future investments.</p><p>Every feature should improve NPV, either increasing revenue or reducing cost. You can’t force better ideas for features, but you can play with their timing. Confidence in your software design skills means you can launch features sooner, believing that whatever design bottlenecks appear you will be able to handle them in the future. Design cost later, better NPV. Feature revenue sooner, better NPV.</p><p>Some folks are fooled by this to believe software design is irrelevant. That’s not true. It’s not just the timing &amp; magnitude of revenue from <em>this </em>feature, but the timing &amp; magnitude of revenue from <em>all </em>future features that roll into NPV. Software design reduces future costs &amp; accelerates future revenue. It’s part of your job to maintain balance between bread today &amp; wheat tomorrow.</p><h2><strong>Optionality: The Hidden Gem</strong></h2><p>The trickiest yet potentially most significant economic driver of software products is optionality. How many different features can you implement next? It’s like keeping multiple doors open, not knowing which one will lead to the treasure room. Software design keeps those door propped open.</p><p>However, the challenge with optionality is its invisibility. You can’t see the options you’ve discarded by taking certain paths, especially when prioritizing short-term NPV. A codebase riddled with quick fixes and technical debt reduces optionality, even though this may not be immediately apparent. The economic impact of lost optionality can be profound, often surpassing the apparent gains from focusing solely on NPV or survival.</p><p>The beauty of optionality is that options <em>increase </em>in value as the future becomes more uncertain. The less you know about the future, the greater the turmoil in the market, the greater the value of your options. And investment in software design creates options.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Interplay of Economic Forces</strong></h2><p>As a technology executive, understanding and navigating these economic drivers is key to making informed decisions that ensure both the immediate and long-term success of software development projects.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will delve into the contrast between the structure and the behavior of software systems. This distinction is crucial in understanding how decisions made at the code level can have far-reaching impacts on the economics of the software. Stay tuned for an exploration of the intricate dance between the structure of a system and its behaviors.</p>
