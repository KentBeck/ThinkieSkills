<p>My last post on pushback seemed a little dark to me. I like to be constructive when possible, so I’ll try to restate my position in a way that invites conversation. I hope you’ll join in.</p><p>I can summarize Empirical Software Design as:</p><ul><li><p>Constantine’s Equivalence states that the cost of software is the coupling in the system.</p></li><li><p>Optimizing cost requires balancing the cost of coupling &amp; the cost of decoupling under conditions of uncertainty.</p></li><li><p>Consider eliminating coupling that does or will increase costs.</p></li><li><p>Strongly consider increasing cohesion.</p></li><li><p>(The above occurs as an exercise in human relationships, which is out of scope for today’s question.)</p></li></ul><p>Experienced designers pushed back on this, saying they had other criteria for “What goes together?”, “What gets separated?”, and “How big should elements be?” The phrase that kept coming up was “functionally related”, as in, “I want sub-elements that are functionally related.”</p><p>Okay, now I can ask the questions:</p><ul><li><p>What is the downside of replacing “functionally related” as the criterion with “increase cohesion, eliminate coupling” as the criterion for design choices?</p></li><li><p>What exactly does “functionally related” mean? Can someone give me examples of things that are functionally related, &amp; things that might seem functionally related but aren’t?</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>I’ll have a final chapter on cohesion out later this week. Then a conclusion &amp; introduction &amp; the draft is complete!</p></blockquote>
