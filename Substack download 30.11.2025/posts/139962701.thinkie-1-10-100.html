<p>Paul Tavis <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7143261282207424512/">posted this Thinkie</a>. I realized have it too, in slightly different form.</p><p>Pattern: progress is blocked by a big, scary worry.</p><p>Transformation: quantify the order of magnitude of the worry.</p><p>“We can’t do that. It’s too expensive.”<br>”$1000? $10,000? $100,000?”<br>”Oh, not $100,000.”</p><p>One of the tricks of using this Thinkie is to pick the magnitudes so the largest one is absurdly high, then work backwards from there.</p><p>Part of what makes this Thinkie work is that it’s not asking for an estimate, which is a potentially unbounded amount of work &amp; creates downside for the estimator.</p><p>This Thinkie also stretches the bounds of what Thinkies are. Like the recent series on decision Thinkies, this is about overcoming unreasonable fear. It doesn’t generate an idea itself, though. What do you think? Is this a Thinkie or not, and why?</p>
