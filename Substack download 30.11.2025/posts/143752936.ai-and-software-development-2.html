<p>Thank you for all the thoughtful comments &amp; discussion about the first post on the topic. People are worried, afraid, maybe a little hopeful, but mostly resigned that the worst possible systemic effects are just what’s going to happen to programmers out of all this brouhaha.</p><p>My points from yesterday:</p><ul><li><p>I’m not worried that the job of programmer will go away, because of various historical analogies. I could be wrong, but I’m happy going with this as an assumption.</p></li><li><p>AI is not being applied to helping programmers learn more faster.</p></li><li><p>AI is not being applied to improve code or system structure. Maybe we assume that an infinitely fast coding AI will be, well, infinitely fast so structure doesn’t matter. I don’t buy it.</p></li></ul><p>Here are 2 more missing topics:</p><ul><li><p>Feedback cycles</p></li><li><p>Human connection</p></li></ul><h2>Feedback Cycles</h2><p>XP identifies the length &amp; quality of feedback cycles as critical to software development. If you don’t know everything you’re going to know, &amp; if what you learn is going to be important, then how fast you learn is more important than what you know right now.</p><p>This is related to the point above about learning, but specifically directed to the length of feedback cycles. I see tools that take minutes to run. Ouch.</p><p>If your goal was to  shorten the latency between human decision &amp; concrete feedback, how would you apply AI differently? Using this assumption you’re likely to come up with different tools than if the goal is to have AIs make bigger decisions &amp; if that delays feedback oh well.</p><h2>Human Connection</h2><p>Another disturbing? regressive? trend I see in AI-based tools for software development is further isolating programmers. “See, you’ll be <em>so</em> fast that you’ll never have to talk to anybody ever again.”</p><p>XP is a set of rituals &amp; rhythms for safe human interaction in the collective enterprise of developing software, even for people who don’t particularly care for human interaction.</p><p>Rather than assume isolation isn’t that bad &amp; increasing isolation well oh well that won’t cause any problems, what if you applied AI to connecting programmers with each other, with users, with managers &amp; other parts of the business?</p><p>My <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/tidyfirst/p/idea-codefeed?r=ehk17&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">idea for CodeFeed</a> is along these lines. What if you had a model watch all the changes to the system? It then introduced people with common goals, styles, or interests.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m sure there’ll be more. In fast moving times, it pays to move fast &amp; worry about tidiness later.</p>
