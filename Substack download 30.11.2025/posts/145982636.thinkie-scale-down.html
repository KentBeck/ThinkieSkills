<p>Pattern: You are stuck &amp; overwhelmed trying to solve a big problem.</p><p>Transformation: What thing would, if you had it, make the big problem more tractable? Make that.</p><p>In a way Scale Down seems like it’s too simple to need naming &amp; explaining. However, when I’m in that moment of overwhelm, that’s exactly when I need the reminder that it’s okay to solve a part of the problem.</p><p>And it’s not just any old part of the problem that called forth by Scale Down, it’s specifically a part of the problem that will make the overall problem easier to solve. “Well, I’ve written one line of code so that’s one less line of code I’ll need to write.” Nope. There aren’t 1000 lines of code to be written. There are &lt;you don’t know how many&gt; lines of code to be written. And you’re feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>“I need to format this data as JSON &amp; send it to the server.” Okay, get “format this data as JSON” working &amp; then the remaining slice of cake will be smaller.</p><p>Here are some criteria you could use to select the Scale Down:</p><ul><li><p>Something you understand well already so you can get some momentum.</p></li><li><p>Something that you need to interact with another team to accomplish. It’s good to do enough work together that you can then proceed independently.</p></li><li><p>Something you don’t understand at all. Knocking this off will buy you big confidence.</p></li><li><p>Something that can already provide customer value. Perhaps you’re working on a calculation with a fancy UI. Implement the calculation &amp; surface it as a spreadsheet macro first.</p></li><li><p>Something that’s kind of a cruddy job.</p></li></ul><p>I’m not sure why I resist Scale Down, but I sure do. I think I retain some amount of shame that I can’t just solve the whole thing all at once. If I was a Real Programmer™️, I could sit down, type really really fast for an uninterrupted hour, &amp; be done. To the amazement of colleagues &amp; onlookers.</p><p>The first step of Scale Down for me is letting go of that shame. Then I can ask, “What is a thing (object, function, service, whatever) which, if I had it, would bring the overall solution closer?”</p>
