<p>Since I accidentally sent out this week’s Thinkie (Invert the Goal) last week I didn’t want to leave you without a Tuesday present. <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/idea-to-impact">Idea to Impact</a> describes how I think about leading change:</p><ol><li><p>Try the idea (preferably a crazy one) on myself.</p></li><li><p>Explain it 1x1 over &amp; over until I find the totem.</p></li><li><p>Repeat the message <em>ad nauseam</em> until I hear someone repeat the message to me.</p></li></ol><p>A <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/tidyfirst/p/thinkie-invert-the-goal?r=ehk17&amp;utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;comments=true&amp;commentId=68447908">comment</a> gave me hope that my message about generating ideas with Thinkies is coming through:</p><div class="pullquote"><p>I am guessing that Kent will come back with his usual: “Thinkies are tools for generating ideas, not just good ideas” :-)</p></div><p>Thanks, <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Vladimir Bychkovsky&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:163481633,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e56c19d6-ec30-4a8d-9989-56df31f6c8a5_2813x2813.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;9d6884d8-8589-41f4-ba1f-da5812f8887b&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>. On the Idea to Impact path I’m somewhere on step 3.</p><p>My only quibble is with the word “just”. To maintain the flow of ideas I don’t want any consideration of quality while an idea is forming. I say, “Thinkies generate ideas, not good ideas.”</p><p>When a Thinkie generates an idea for you, it isn’t good or bad. It’s in Idea Limbo. That’s where it belongs. Let it form fully. Okay, I can see it now. The whole thing. I’m not committed to it. My ego won’t be bruised if it turns out to be useless. My self-image won’t be inflated if it turns out to be judged “brilliant” by others. It is its own thing, complete in itself.</p><p>Breathe in through the nose. Hold it. Out through the mouth. Okay, now how I can invalidate this idea as quickly &amp; cheaply as possible?</p><p>This is the fundamental skill of Thinkies. However large or small your Thinkie collection, generating value depends on allowing ideas to form first. Taking a breath. And then evaluating the ideas cheaply.</p><blockquote><p>I’m launching a workshop for non-technical executives—<a href="https://leadgeekswithpurpose.substack.com/">Lead Geeks With Purpose</a>.
