<p>This is the story of how I misled myself for 40 years based on what a guru said &amp; what I’m doing about it now.</p><p>My grandfather had the knack of having money pass through his fingers. Every time it did the crumbs would fall into his lap. He was a successful local car dealer, a business he started when he &amp; his brother realized they could get a discount on their Packards if they signed up as dealers &amp; ordered 3 cars. That car sold so quickly they ordered more. Thirty years later when I came on the scene he had a thriving business.</p><p>It wasn’t just cars, it was everything. Want to use a piece of art as trade-in for car? Sure. Grampy would figure out how to sell it for a profit. Trouble making house payments? Grampy would help &amp; somehow end up with the house. Have a truck coming back from Los Angeles? Grampy would find some oranges to pack in it &amp; sell when they got north. Everything was a potential deal.</p><p>Everything. I idolized my grandfather. I spent endless hours in the corner of his office, playing with toy cars &amp; listening to him make deals. To this day I have a negotiation mode that kicks in at certain times &amp; I know I’m channeling what I learned there. But I also saw the price.</p><p>Everything &amp; everyone was fair game, including family. He would happily lie &amp; cheat if it improved the deal for him. A part of me recoiled from what I saw. (If you think this was confusing for a kid, you’re right.)</p><h2>R.

I found the writing of R. Buckminster Fuller. I had been aware of him as the inventor of the geodesic dome, but in 1981 he published <em>Critical Path</em>, an only-relatively-readable summary of his work. In it he describes his approach to business:</p><blockquote><p>I assumed that nature would “evaluate” my work as I went along. If I was doing what nature wanted done, and if I was doing it in promising ways, permitted by nature’s principles, I would find my work being economically sustained</p></blockquote><p>More succinctly:</p><blockquote><p>…nature did not require hydrogen to “earn a living” before allowing hydrogen to behave in the unique manner it does.</p></blockquote><p>Eureka! Here was the way out of my dilemma. I wanted to do big things but I didn’t want to become like my grandfather. All I had to do was to maximize the benefit I created for the most possible people &amp; the universe would provide.</p><h2>It Kinda Worked…</h2><p>I didn’t do badly. I was able to build a reasonably lucrative consulting business through the spread of object-oriented programming. I built my dream house on 20 acres of southern Oregon. TDD, then JUnit, then Extreme Programming were hits.</p><p>I never made comfort money, never became “post economic”. I had several chances but in each case I stood on my fullerene principles—nature would provide. If nature wasn’t providing I would just create more value.</p><h2>…Until It Didn’t</h2><p>Two events coincided to break the connection between value creation &amp; value reception. The week after 9/11/2001 the year-long backlog of lucrative work I had scheduled simply evaporated. At the same time I began to grapple with the darker side of my grandfather’s legacy. I had a breakdown.</p><p>The years after that were hard. Residual publishing income &amp; the last of my inherited money got us through. Then I put myself back together enough to get into fairly-early Facebook (not before-the-Microsoft-deal Facebook, though). That got all the kids through college.</p><p>My divorce took the rest of my assets &amp; left me owing a substantial monthly alimony payment for life. Once I left Facebook, though, I resolved to double down on Fuller’s principles as I understood them. I would do the most good I could for the most people. Nature would provide.</p><p>No, nature would not. By the time I got to Gusto I was broke. I’ve described this as <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/envy-brings-a-lesson">being in a kayak</a> just upstream of a waterfall paddling as fast as I possibly could just so I didn’t go over.</p><h2>And Now…</h2><p>I’m comfortable again. I have enough &amp; enough more that I can decide how to enjoy life. My work at Mechanical Orchard has been fantastic so far. I raised my speaking rates. I don’t have enough that I can stop paddling. I’m not sure I ever will. But I’m doing okay for now. I’m okay.</p><p>And along came SubStack. Honestly all I expected was a few hundred bucks a month to guilt myself into finishing writing <em>Tidy First?</em>. Well, that worked (real books appear at the end of October!) But also the revenue grew enough that I could tell there is a real business opportunity here.</p><p>Before I can capitalize, though, I have to wrestle some false beliefs. The first is my naive interpretation of Fuller that “nature will provide”. No, I’m going to have to create a channel for value to flow back to me.</p><p>The second is my childhood-formed belief that business is like my grandfather’s business, taking absolutely everything I can for myself &amp; to hell with everyone else. I’m afraid of a business because I don’t want to be that person. I don’t have to be. I can run a business that’s good for customers &amp; good for me.</p><p>Whew! That was hard to say. Only took me 50 years to say it.</p><h2>Next?</h2><p>I can see 3 trajectories for my SubStack-based revenue:</p><ul><li><p>Status quo. I can buy a car a year. It’s a nice bump to my income but I have to keep doing everything else I’m doing. Nice thing about this scenario is that I know I can do it, I know I like doing it, &amp; I know I can live with myself.</p></li><li><p>Growth. A 4X growth in revenue seems achievable. I need to run it as a business. I need to execute on all that paid-newsletter stuff, but in a way that’s good for readers. I’d still need other income. This scares me because I’m afraid of sliding into my grandfather’s slimy, “Oh that’s for <em>paying</em> customers only.”</p></li><li><p>Hit. The most profitable SubStacks are bringing in 20X what I am. At that point I wouldn’t need other sources of income for both daily use &amp; saving for retirement. That would be amazing but I can’t see how to get there from here.</p></li></ul><p>So that’s where I am. I’m still afraid of business because of what it represents for me. I’m finally over my version of Fuller’s “nature will provide”. That was just me running from myself.</p><p>I’m ready to care for my whole community to the best of my ability (free subscribers). I feel grateful to my paying subscribers for their support &amp; that gratitude naturally expresses itself (paying subscribers are getting an early look at a project of mine called Thinkies). My founding members have a special place in my heart. And all of it adds up to more freedom for me to express myself on behalf of my fellow geeks.</p><p>Not gonna lie, this feels weird. I’m confronting 40, sometimes 50-year-old fears. I have help—business coach, marketing coach, help from SubStack. I can envision a better future—more value for you all, more freedom for me. One paying subscriber at a time.</p>
