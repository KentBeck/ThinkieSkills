<p>A friend was responsible for the architecture of a large, successful software product. The product needed to handle sensitive information responsibly, so the design called for a single sub-element to have that information written to it but never retrieved from it.</p><p>The company bought a complementary product whose team was asked to integrate with the original product. The shortest path to integration was to retrieve the sensitive information from the trusted sub-element. My friend shut those plans down pronto. Regardless of how much more work it would be, integration could not be allowed to compromise security.</p><p>In this case the tradeoff was clear--in no universe was the value of integration great enough to overcome the existential risk of exposing sensitive information. The example exposes a genuine management problem:</p><ul><li><p>Sometimes the tradeoff is less clear. What happens when implementing a feature "damanges" the design? Sometimes it will be worth it &amp; sometimes it won't.</p></li><li><p>Different people have different incentives. The feature implementor, in the worst case, doesn't care about the design just as the designer, in the worst case, doesn't care about features.</p></li><li><p>Different people have different skills &amp; perspectives. There are folks who care more about features, are more skilled at implementing features, just as there are folks who better envision improved structures &amp; how to get there from here.</p></li></ul><p>In the long story of a software project, what one person does on any given day is unlikely to matter, but mutual respect &amp; balance between features &amp; structure does matter. Software design, once again, as an exercise in human relationships.</p><h2>Structure "Damage"</h2><p>In what follows I will talk about "structure damage", but what does that mean? Structure exists to enable future change. If we didn't have to change the software, the structure wouldn't matter. Structure damage, then, is changes to the structure that make future features more difficult. In the story above, the damage was that once the sensitive information escaped the trusted sub-element, proving that it wasn't escaping further would be more difficult or impossible. Every future feature would either bear the cost of careful analysis or, should careful analysis seem to expensive, bear the risk of exposing sensitive information.</p><p>Constantine's Equivalence reminds us that the cost of software is roughly equal to coupling. Structure can be damaged by introducing coupling. Cohesion is the flip side of coupling. Structure can be damaged by reducing cohesion.</p><p>Sometimes structure damage is a price you are willing to pay for a feature. If the feature is valuable enough &amp; time is too short to tidy first, then you hold your nose &amp; code. A challenge comes when the person rewarded for the feature is different from the person or people who have to pay the cost of the damage in the future, either by enduring slower development or by restoring the structure.</p><h2>Feature Folks</h2><p>Another friend, a skilled software designer, once had a collaborative project with a researcher. The researcher didn't care a whit about design, just about making the system do interesting &amp; unusual new behaviors. My friend complained to me, "They just don't care. I set the design up to support what they imagine. They implement their new feature but completely destroy the design in the process. I spend a couple of days fixing the damage &amp; improving the design. Then they come back &amp; destroy it again."</p><p>My friend felt disrespected. No amount of clean-up was going to fix the problem. My friend valued the design. The researcher valued only whizzy features.</p><p>That word "only" is the problem. We have different oars but we're propelling the same boat.</p><p>If you are a feature-focused person:</p><ul><li><p>Work within the design if possible.</p></li><li><p>If not, do whatever you need to do to demonstrate the new feature. You're not done though.</p></li><li><p>If you've sinned getting to a demo, see if you can implement the feature another way without damage.</p></li><li><p>Use basic code hygene, as described in "Implementation Patterns" for example, as a base level of respect for structure.</p></li><li><p>If the current structure truly interferes with your desired feature, tidy first or tidy after, perhaps with the collaboration of a structure-oriented person. The most power design question of all is, "What structure would, if I had it, make this feature easier to implement?"</p></li></ul><h2>Structure Folks</h2><p>Sometimes I wear this hat. I <em>love</em> a tidy structure. However, the structure will never be all that I can imagine it being. Some thoughts:</p><ul><li><p>It's my job to encourage new features.</p></li><li><p>Some amount of damage is the price of progress. However, there are also red lines, like the one regarding sensitive information, that can never be crossed. Keep as little of the system inside that line as possible.</p></li><li><p>Structure damage is the seed of future improvement. I may need to wait for inspiration before I know how to improve the structure or to know how to get from here to there in small, safe steps, but that's also the price of longer-term progress.</p></li><li><p>Prepare to listen to the needs of feature folks, especially when they contradict your preconceptions.</p></li></ul><p>I've seen structure-obsessed developers insist that progress on features cannot start until after a lengthy sequence of speculative design decisions. We've talk about how this strategy reduces the net present value of the project. As freeing as it is to design on a clean sheet of paper, only indulge momentarily. Revenue &amp; feedback both refine &amp; motivate design.</p><h2>Managing Structure Folks &amp; Feature Folks</h2><p>Pure feature or structure folks are rare. Both are dangerous to the health of projects. However, the distinction is real. Some folks get their juice from seeing users doing something new, something they implemented. Others gain energy from knowing that the software is prepared to be more capable in the future. As a manager, it's your job to reconcile these perspectives.</p><p>Some suggestions:</p><ul><li><p>Remind everyone frequently that they are paddling the same boat, that they are progressing toward the same destination.</p></li><li><p>Celebrate progress on both fronts, features &amp; structure.</p></li><li><p>Encourage collaboration between feature &amp; structure folks, especially when there is tension.</p></li><li><p>Back up the structure folks when a real red line is tested.</p></li><li><p>Remind structure folks to work in small, safe steps so feature progress is not blocked for long.</p></li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Healthy software needs progress on both features &amp; structure, on net present value &amp; optionality. The rewards come to those who reconcile the perspectives &amp; skills to maintain that balance.</p>
