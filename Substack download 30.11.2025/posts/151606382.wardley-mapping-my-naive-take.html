<p>I want to understand Wardley Mapping, I really do. Why else would I have watched all those talks, read the book cover to cover, tried to map random things. About the only thing I haven’t done is sit down with an experienced practitioner to solve a real problem. Come to think of it, that’s what I should have done first. Ah, well, social anxiety.</p><p>I finally did apply some of that in-person magic by attending Simon’s mapping workshop at GOTO Copenhagen a month ago. I got to ask at least some of my questions (I know (now) not to dominate a conversation with my questions). And Simon &amp; I got to talk about a variety of topics, about which more in a later post.</p><p>Here, then, is my naive current understanding of what Wardley Mapping is about. I publish this with some trepidation because I expect experienced Wartographers to “well actually” the hell out of this. But then I’ll learn something. So, win/win.</p><h2>Investment</h2><p>We’re in some situation. We have limited capital. We want return. Of all the things we <em>could</em> invest in, which <em>should</em> we invest in &amp; which should we ignore? When we invest, what should our risk stack look like to improve outcomes?</p><p>The fundamental questions to be answered in Wardley Mapping are:</p><ol><li><p>What should we invest in?</p></li><li><p>In what way should we invest?
