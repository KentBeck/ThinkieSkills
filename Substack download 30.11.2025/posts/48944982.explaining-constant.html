<p>So you're reading along and you see a number you don't recognize. Or you're reading along and you see a constant string repeated all over the code. You figure out what the constant <em>means</em>.</p><p>Create a symbolic constant. Replace uses of the literal constant with the symbol.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>I mean, c'mon. I've been seeing this advice since I was a wee little programmer &amp; yet still somehow folks think this is okay:</p><pre><code>if response.code = 404
  ...blah blah blah...</code></pre><p>Okay, I got blame-y there for a second. We're not here to judge the person who made the mess (protip: it might be us). We're here to take care of ourselves by tidying first before changing things.</p><pre><code>PAGE_NOT_FOUND := 404
if response.code = PAGE_NOT_FOUND
  ....blah blah blah...</code></pre><p>Be careful. The same literal can appear in 2 places and mean something different. It doesn't help to tidy to:</p><pre><code>ONE = 1
...ONE... # everywhere you need unity</code></pre><p>You're reading. You understand. You're putting that understanding into the code so you don't have to hold it in your head.</p><p>There are a few tidyings downstream of this one about putting constants that change together or need to be understood together in one place &amp; separating them from constants that cluster for other reasons. I'm going to let you figure those out. Coupling, cohesion, just do your thing.</p>
