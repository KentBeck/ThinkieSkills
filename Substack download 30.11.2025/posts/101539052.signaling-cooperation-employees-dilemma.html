<p>I’m assuming you’ve heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoners’ Dilemma</a>. My summary: 2 people are arrested. If neither tattles they both go free. If one tattles &amp; the other doesn’t, the tattler goes free &amp; the other person goes to jail for a long time. If they both tattle, they both go to jail for a shorter sentence. (The payoffs vary in different versions of PD.)</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png" width="1456" height="878" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:878,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1811014,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OU9P!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3520bb-9305-440c-b1e4-1007d63951f7_1606x968.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>PD model the value of selfishness.

The way the most needs can get met is if both parties treat the other fairly:</p><ul><li><p>The boss offers good working conditions &amp; fair pay.</p></li><li><p>The employee offers their best efforts.</p></li></ul><h2>Cooperate/Cooperate</h2><p>It’s in both parties’ best interest to stay in the top left. Given the power disadvantage, how does the employee know to trust the boss not slip down to the bottom left? After all, if the boss defects &amp; the employee still cooperates, that’s the worst situation for the employee. And empirically many employers try to sneak into the lower left.</p><p>That’s where responsibility comes in handy. By visibly routing negative consequences towards power, the advantaged party is saying, “You can trust me. I’m feeling as much (or more) pain than you are.”</p><ul><li><p>Your options are under water? I’ve had my options repriced to the worst price any of you have.</p></li><li><p>Your salary is cut? Mine is cut more.</p></li></ul><p>Having opened this door, there are way more questions to ponder which I don’t have time for now. Why do bosses so frequently defect? Why can’t we create better incentives to cooperate? What do the relative payoffs look like in realistic scenarios? What other honest signals can the powerful send?</p><h2>Software Design</h2><p>And now finally back to our topic: software design. The motto of Empirical Software Design is (repeat after me), “Software design is an exercise in human relationships.” These relationships necessarily contain power differentials. I know more about this code than you do. You have better credibility with reviewers than I do. And on and on.</p><p>On the engineering side of the team we get the best results when we cooperate. Software design is part of that cooperation. But I’m going to make decisions (exercising power) that impact you &amp; vice versa. How are we going to maintain our position in the top left quadrant?</p><p>By aligning authority &amp; responsibility. If I change an API that you use, then I either migrate your usages myself or we do it together or I maintain backwards compatibility. In other words, I own the consequences of my software design decisions. I send you a signal that I’m cooperating, that it’s safe for you to continue cooperating. And we both get more of our needs met.</p><p>So I finally have the theme for book 2 in the series—aligning authority &amp; responsibility. Now, if that seems like too small of a topic for a whole book, rest assured that seems like too small of a topic for a whole book to me too. Experience shows, however, that this is about the right size once all is said &amp; done. We’ll see.</p><p>Thank all of you who are supporting this writing, whether by paying or by trying the ideas &amp; writing about them or telling your colleagues. I wouldn’t do it without you.</p>
