<blockquote><p>This is from a new archival source—the original WikiWikiWeb. The page doesn’t have a creation date that I could find but it would be around 2000.</p><p>The topic seems apropos to The Forest &amp; The Desert. In The Desert you don’t dare let go of the yoke because you already don’t have enough control. In The Forest, you can need less steering &amp; it turns out that less steering leads to greater satisfaction all around.</p></blockquote><p>An airplane's direction and altitude is controlled primarily by a 2D steering wheel called a "yoke" (plus other inputs like the rudder pedals, which don't bear on this story). When my ex-father-in-law first showed me how to fly, I immediately grabbed the yoke with both hands. We bounced around a bit. Then he showed me how much smoother I could fly straight and level with only one hand on the yoke.</p><p>An airplane is much more sensitive to controls than a car. Small inputs create large changes. Coordinating the pressure of two hands generates many, many small inputs. Counter-intuitive as it feels at the time, 10,000 feet up in a tiny little cigar tube, letting one hand go is the right way to solve the problem.</p><p>Now, when you do a maneuver, you do hold the yoke with both hands. Then you need the power provided by both armsful of muscles. At least you want that power available, and you are willing to pay the price in a little wiggliness, at least for the duration of the turn.</p><p>An <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeTeam">ExtremeTeam</a> is sensitive to small inputs. Much better to let one hand go and trust the self-organizing culture they have developed. Most of the time.</p><div><hr></div><p>Another example of this is my rolling suitcase. The wheels are too close together, so it often starts oscillating between the wheels, eventually falling over. I tried grabbing tighter, which started the oscillation sooner and toppled the suitcase sooner. The solution is to pull the dang thing with one finger. Occasionally (but much less often) it still begins to wobble. I slow down until it stops.</p><blockquote><p>I replaced the suitcase with a 4-wheeled Tumi. Problem solved.</p></blockquote>
