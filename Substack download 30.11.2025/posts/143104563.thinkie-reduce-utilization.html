<p>Pattern: We need to get more done but we’re already busy as we can be.</p><p>Transformation: What would happen if we <em>reduced</em> utilization?</p><p>Reduce Utilization is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingman%27s_formula">Kingman’s Formula</a> which states the unintuitive (to many folks) result that as utilization of a rate-limiting resource approaches 100%, the time required to process a new item of work approaches infinity. Yep, ∞. The big forever. Is that really what you want, to only work on existing work or, put the other way, to never work on anything that comes up? Nobody wants that.</p><p>Reduce Utilization is a great Thinkie because it’s backwards of how most people think. We aren’t getting enough done. How do we go faster? Nope. If we slow down, what happens then? Maybe the ideas generated won’t work, or won’t be accepted, but that’s okay. Thinkies are for generating ideas, not good ideas.</p><p>Traffic sees this Thinkie at work. Traffic jam? Reduce the number of cars on the road. Teams can use it too. People are rushing around making work for each other? Sign up for half the work for a while.</p><p>I used this with the last team I managed. On Monday no one was allowed to sign up for more than half the work they thought they could accomplish. This allowed space for pairing &amp; for all the work items that came up during the week.</p><p>[Note to self, also have to write Latency Or Throughput, Reduce Variance]</p>
