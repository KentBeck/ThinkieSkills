<p>The last language-oriented Thinkie is contrarianism in action.</p><p>Pattern: Someone begins a sentence with, “Obviously…”</p><p>Transformation: Ask yourself what is true if they are wrong. What happens if you make the opposite assumption.</p><p>Example: “Obviously, bigger organizations [ed: I almost wrote “bitter organizations”] go slower.” Why is this the assumption? I mean, it seems to be empirically true, but it also seems like an excuse to not even try. What if you say I know we’re bigger but how much of our speed can we retain?</p><p>I hope you’re getting the pattern. Match/transform/evaluate. Most times the reason things are obvious is because they are true. Every once in a while obvious things turn out to be used-to-be-true, or mostly-true. If you can spot one of those cases, your idea will tend to be:</p><ul><li><p>Unusual (what folks seem to mean by “creative”)</p></li><li><p>Valuable</p></li></ul><p>Try this Thinkie out.
