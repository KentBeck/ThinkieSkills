<p>Come raise a glass with me &amp; your fellow founders to celebrate the actual physical publication of <em>Tidy First?</em>. I so appreciate the time &amp; freedom you’ve given me to say something I think is important for our profession.</p><p>I’ll tell stories of the writing of the book, all 18 years of it. We’ll talk about what comes next for the book launch. Then we’ll talk book 2 topics (of course I have way too much scope in mind—could use help sorting it out).</p><p>Since we have the whole unsynchronized daylight saving time thing going on, I’m going to rely on Google Calendar to get the times right for everybody. <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=MjNrZzlxbGZuZzczZGJybG43MWMwZnRuaWMga2VudGxiZWNrQG0&amp;tmsrc=kentlbeck%40gmail.com">Here’s the link</a>.</p>
