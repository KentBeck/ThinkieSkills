<p>I just had the pleasure of reading “A City Is Not A Tree: 50th Anniversary Edition”. Contrarian architect Christopher Alexander noted in 1965 that urban planners treated separate neighborhoods as entirely separate. Planned cities like Brasilia had a sector for hotels, a sector for government buildings, a sector for recreation. You could draw a tree structure to describe such a city.</p><p>Such a reductionist approach is both factually incorrect &amp; ineffective as a planning tool. A building can be, should be, residential <em>and</em> commercial. A street can be, should be, a path <em>and</em> a destination. A neighborhood can be, should be, a place to live <em>and</em> a place to work.</p><p>In Alexander’s metaphor, a city should be seen, not as a tree, but as a lattice. Elements of the city should be members of multiple sets at once. Such an analysis is harder, messier, more complicated than analysis when you assume that each element is a member of exactly one set, but multi-layered living provides opportunities for serendipity.</p><h2>OKRs</h2><p>Re-reading A City Is Not A Tree got me thinking about the reductionist, tree-like styles of management I’ve bumped into during my career. There must be something seductive about seeing a company as a tree, because people keep trying to apply the metaphor even when it clearly (to me, anyway) doesn’t fit.</p><p>Take OKRs, for a recent example. There’s an org chart. The leaves on the tree have OKRs. Add up all the KRs for the individual contributors &amp; you have the KRs for the team. Add all the team KRs up &amp; you have the org KRs. And up &amp; up until you have KRs for the whole company.</p><p>Maybe the process runs the other way. The company has KRs which are parceled out among the orgs, which parcel them out to teams &amp; so down to individuals.</p>
