<p>Another human aspect of software design is slicing and chunking for understanding. To change software we need to understand it. To understand it we have to understand it in chunks (for example, figuring out which parts we can ignore for the moment). Making chunks is exactly the method of software design.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1354418068869398538?s=20">This tweet</a> blew up today:</p><blockquote><p>The goal of software design is to create chunks or slices that fit into a human mind. The software keeps growing but the human mind maxes out, so we have to keep chunking and slicing differently if we want to keep making changes.</p></blockquote><p>Note the distinction between chunking and slicing.</p><ul><li><p>Chunking is the containment hierarchy of elements—repos containing services containing modules containing…</p></li><li><p>Slicing goes across chunks—observability, recoverability, accessibility.</p></li></ul><p>Sometimes changes to one will spill over to changes in the other.</p><p>When I said, “Software design is an exercise in human relationships,” I actually meant something quite different. I’ll get to that in future posts.</p>
