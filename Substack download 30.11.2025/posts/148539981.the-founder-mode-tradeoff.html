<p>Okay, everybody is weighing in but I have a thing to say I haven’t seen elsewhere so I’ll just say it.</p><p>To recap, <a href="https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">Paul Graham says</a> that the orthodoxy for CEOs of “hire good people &amp; let them do their jobs” is wrong. Founder Mode is the alternative—stay involved in all the details of the business. Micro-manage. Wander around. Talk to everybody. Circumvent all the channels. Correct the details.</p><p>First, I think Paul is essentially right <em>but</em> that the way he expresses his idea is shallow, ineffective, &amp; prone to cause unneeded suffering. (Before I go further, I’ll point out that my experience is as one of the led, not one of the leaders. The times I’ve been the leader—patterns, JUnit, TDD, XP—my constraints &amp; incentives were very different from those of commercial CEOs. Apply grains of salt.)</p><h2>Purpose: Survival</h2><p>First, the primary purpose of the kind of leadership Paul discusses is the continued existence of the business. Everything bows to survival. As I discussed previously, <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/game-over-absorbs-future-winnings">game over absorbs future winnings</a>.</p><p>Survival is an asymmetrical game. There are many ways to die, a few ways to win. And those few ways are the result of long chains of not-dying decisions. What behavior leads to better chances of survival?</p><p>I’m going to speculate that deadly decisions are actually the interaction of two seemingly-innocuous decisions more often than they are one big blooper. [ed: need examples] If this is true, then the CEO really does have a unique role to play—spotting the Mentos &amp; the Coke before they come together.</p><p>Here’s the thing—most decisions aren’t like this. Encouraging founders to get involved in all decisions (even if that isn’t what Paul <em>said</em>, that’s how some folks will read it) <em>reduces</em> the chance of catching interactions. Cultivating a sensitive sniffer for possible danger &amp; only then getting involved increases the chance of survival.</p><h2>Iteration</h2><p>Second, business is an iterative game. CEOs don’t just call “Heads!” once &amp; win or lose. Each decision has 2 outputs:</p><ul><li><p>The consequences of the decision itself.</p></li><li><p>A new organization more or less prepared to make the next decision.</p></li></ul><p>Paul ignores this second output entirely. What does it do to the people in the organization and the organization as a whole when the CEO jumps in and changes a decision in someone’s area of expertise? Even if the CEO is right, in the sense that the change increases the chances of survival?</p><p>Damage. Damage that needs to be repaired in order to restore an organization prepared to make good decisions next time.</p><p>Yes, there’s a benefit to the Founder Mode decision but there’s also a cost. Ignore the cost &amp; CEOs will find themselves more likely to have to intervene at the same time as the number of decisions &amp; the complexity of the interactions between decisions grows. Something will eventually give.</p><h2>Chordal Connections</h2><p>Founder CEOs have 3 (at least) advantages that give them a unique ability to create value (i.e. increase the survival chances).</p><ul><li><p>Social capital. The Founder CEO can escape local maxima that no one else would think of escaping.</p></li><li><p>Breadth + depth. The Founder CEO knows a little bit about the whole business &amp; the people involved. These chordal connections position them to spot and (using their social capital) avoid survival-threatening combinations of decisions.</p></li><li><p>Incentives. Professional managers are also playing an iterative game, looking to their performance in this gig to set up their next gig. The Founder CEO is all in on this hand.</p></li></ul><p>Wielding power comes at a cost. Ignoring that cost serves no one in the long run. We all love a good hero story, but it’s not the whole story.</p>
