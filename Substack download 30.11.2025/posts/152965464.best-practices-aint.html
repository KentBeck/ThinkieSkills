Mea culpa: I once published a book with “Best Practice” in the title. Most uses of the phrase, though, are distracting at best, confusing and misleading at worst. Given the increasing use of the phrase (at one employer, 19 Slack channels include it in their title, more data needed), here’s some perspective for “best practice”.</p><div><hr></div><p>Quick thank you to my first sponsor, <a href="https://tuple.app/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=kent+beck+1">Tuple</a></p><h1><a href="https://tuple.app/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=kent+beck+1">Tuple</a>—Fun Collaboration Now</h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png" width="1456" height="662" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:662,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:244103,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8JvW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e58307-3998-45d6-a8cc-cb994f8730c0_2750x1250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Collaboration enhances focus.

Best practices are expected to have predictable effects, so they fail when applied to chaotic problems. Better to act first and analyze later. With a chaotic problem, almost any action will produce useful feedback.</p></li><li><p><em>Complex</em> problems display a connection between action and effect, but only in retrospect. Applying a best practice will not get you what you expect. Instead, your best strategy is to invent an action based on first principles (like “move fast and break things” or “make decisions reversible”), and observe the results.</p></li><li><p><em>Complicated</em> problems have a, well, complicated connection between action and effect, but at least they are predictable. <em>A</em> best practice is not effective, but choosing among a pallette of known-good practices is.</p></li><li><p><em>Simple</em> problems have a clear, linear connection between action and effect. When solving simple problems, effort used to invent or choose between actions is a waste of time. Applying the best practice is efficient.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>Misuse</strong></h2><p>Having been through a few “best practice” wars, I have seen two dysfunctions with the phrase. Sometimes advice givers use it to mask lack of confidence. “Do what I say because it is a best practice.” Sometimes advice takers use it to try to duck responsibility. “But I was using a best practice.” Neither is consistent with effective development.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>When you have a simple problem, by all means seek out and refine the best practice. For problems where the connection between action and effect are still coming into focus, derive actions from first principles or choose from among known-goods. But don’t call it “best” practice if it ain’t.</p>
