I’m glad you’re here.</p></blockquote><p>“Tidy first?” is a question that comes up ten times a day for programmers. You need to change the behavior of some code. The code is messy in a way that makes the change harder than necessary. Should you tidy it up before making the change?</p><p>Neither dogmatic answer satisfies. If you <em>always</em> tidy <em>everything</em> that’s messy, you’ll spend almost all your time tidying &amp; little time delivering new features. If instead you focus on just changing the behavior of the code regardless of the mess, then the mess accumulates &amp; changes become harder &amp; harder. More than just the increasing cost of change are all the changes you don’t even try because you don’t want to face the mess.</p><p>The software design techniques discussed in Tidy First? will expand in subsequent books (also to be published here first) to techniques for teams of programmers &amp; later to cross-functional teams. First, though, we’re going to focus on you &amp; making your daily programming more effective.</p><p>Paid subscribers get complete chapters as they are drafted, approximately one a week.
