Before you start an experiment, you specify how much time or money you’re going to spend on it. When the timer <em>ding</em>s, you put your pencil down, roll back from your desk, heave a big sigh, maybe shed a tear, and then roll up and get started on the next thing.</p><p>Timeboxing is based on the sunk cost fallacy, the cognitive bias where we assign too large a value or too great a chance of success to an activity that has already cost us a lot. The end of the timebox is intended to give rational thought a chance to intervene, to evaluate more accurately the chance of success.</p><p>My friend pointed out that there another rationalizing force at work: FOMO. Every day you spend in <em>this</em> project is a day you aren’t spending on <em>that.</em> And <em>that</em>. And <em>that</em>. If a project isn’t going well, pretty soon you’re going to reach the margin where another project starts looking mighty tasty.</p>
