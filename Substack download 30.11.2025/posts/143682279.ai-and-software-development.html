<p>I don’t have a comprehensive take on AI &amp; software development, but I do have Some Thoughts I’m comfortable sharing with you paying subscribers. I hope we can have a conversation here to help refine our collective thinking.</p><h2>Jobs</h2><p>“AI is going to take away all the programming jobs”—bollocks. There’s this technology that will enable business people to state their desires in plain English, bypassing the need for programmers. It’s called COBOL. Oh, wait, 4GL. No, CASE. No, no, it’s called NoCode…</p><p>Programmers are advised to think about why “they” keep trying to replace “us”. We are kinda assholes sometimes. In the meantime, much as they’d like to they haven’t been able to replace us before &amp; I see no reason why it will happen this time.</p><h2>Jevons’</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg" width="220" height="279" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:279,&quot;width&quot;:220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;William Jevons&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="William Jevons" title="William Jevons" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-os!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e11b4-555e-43bb-9989-3cccdfcd4bf1_220x279.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bill’s Not Worried</figcaption></figure></div><p>The success of the Newcomen steam engine meant that England was running out of coal. James Watt optimized the steam engine resulting in a reduction in the consumption of coal. WRONG! Watt’s optimizations resulted in an <em>increase</em> in the consumption of coal.</p><p>William Jevons figured out that this was because greater efficiency meant that there were more economically viable uses for steam engines. More steam engines, more coal consumption.</p><p>Fortunately, many of the steam engines were employed pumping water out of coal mines, so England didn’t end up running out of coal.</p><p>The lesson I take from Jevons’ Paradox is that if we genuinely make programming cheaper, it will likely result in an <em>increase</em> in the demand for programming &amp; thus an <em>increase</em> in the demand for programmers.</p><h2>Learning or Dumbing?</h2><p>A message I see consistently is that now less-skilled programmers will be able to do the tasks of higher-skilled programmers. I can see the attraction of this—why pay $100 for a widget if you can get the same for $50? However, I think it misses a longer-term opportunity.</p><p>What if we applied the same technology but to helping less-skilled programmers learn &amp; grow? Some of the “explain these weird log files” models seem pointed in the direction of learning, but the whole learning &amp; growth direction could be more of a theme.</p><h2>Structure</h2><p>All of the demos I’ve seen are directed at behavior—implement this new feature. Makes some sense. Features are tangible, legible, cash-flow-connected.</p><p>What about structure? “What would the structure need to be so this feature is easier to implement?” This isn’t a question that matters if your AI truly is infinitely fast at producing correct features. All you need to do is reproduce the entire system from scratch every time.</p><p>Color me skeptical. I think there’s an information theory/thermodynamics argument that suggests that if the structure is not kept healthy. adding features to a system will eventually become prohibitively expensive based just on the cost of electricity.</p><p>“What would the structure need to be so this feature is easy to implement?” is my favorite question in design. I’d love some help. Oh, and also some help with, “…and how do you get there from here in small, safe steps?”</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>That’s my list for today. What am I missing? Where am I wrong? Exciting times we’re living in folks.</p>
