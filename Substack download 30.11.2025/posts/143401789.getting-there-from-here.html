<p>Getting ramped up to write book 2 &amp; I keep thinking of book 3 topics. I’ll record them with you so I have them some place &amp; so you know a bit about what is coming. (Oh, yeah, gotta finish Surprise Factory first too. Busy busy.)</p><p>The theory section of book 3 is going to go as deep as I know how to go. I expect to cover Philip Ball (“Flow, Shapes, Branches”), Christopher Alexander going to back to Notes on the Synthesis of Form, &amp; D’Arcy Thompson.</p><p>Thompson’s “On Growth &amp; Form” was required reading for the deep geeks a generation before me. He goes into the details of the forms in natural, including some amazing illustrations of radiolarians. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg" width="1024" height="1449" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1449,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;undefined&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="undefined" title="undefined" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rJw2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab3305fd-9e90-4817-b77c-389d8be60607_1024x1449.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Biologists of the time were waxing poetic about how beautifully adapted biology was to their ecological niche. Look at those bees using hexagons to enclose the maximum space with the minimum material! Amazing.</p><p>Thompson (in my reading) gives this kind of thinking a shrug. Instead, he focuses on how those structures get there. It doesn’t matter how perfectly adapted a structure is if the organism can’t construct it with time/materials/threats/processing on hand. Bees don’t have many neurons, so building a hexagonal structure is about as complicated as they can get.</p><p>There is still magic in a spider spinning a web. The structure that appears is intricate to our eyes, perfectly adapted to catching prey, resistant to wind, &amp; so on. We can also be amazed that a brain with that few neurons &amp; that many legs to control can actually control the construction process. But in the end, the spider has to be able to get there from here.</p><p>This is a topic I want to cover deeply in book 3. Too often software designers wander off into cloud cuckoo land without thinking, “Hmmm, can this team &amp; this business &amp; this codebase with this usage pattern &amp; this growth trajectory get there from here?”</p>
