<h2>From Tidying Alone to Tidying Together: Where Software Design Takes Us Next</h2><p>This book started from a foundation of <em>Tidy First?</em>—coupling and cohesion, options and cash flow, big changes in small safe steps, and above all software design as an exercise in human relationships.</p><p>In this book we've expanded on those themes—power laws governing the evolution of software, survival as a prerequisite to balancing options and cash flow, big changes across time and team boundaries, software that's grown not assembled, and above all software design as an exercise in human relationships. (Is that getting boring yet? I hope not. It's the thread that ties everything together.)</p><p>The journey from tidying alone to tidying together has revealed new layers of complexity. When you're tidying for yourself, the challenges are mostly technical and personal. When you're refactoring with a team, the challenges become deeply social. The same forces are at play—coupling still drives cost, cohesion still enables change, options still create value. But now these forces operate through human relationships, amplified by trust or diminished by friction.</p><h2>What We've Learned</h2><p>We've seen how refactorings differ from tidyings not just in scale but in kind. A parameter object that touches six layers of your system isn't just a bigger guard clause—it's a shared vocabulary your team will use for months or years. Moving from function calls to events isn't just a structural change—it's a new way of thinking about system interactions that everyone needs to understand.</p><p>We've discovered that managing these changes requires new skills. It's not enough to know how to execute a refactoring safely. You need to know:</p><ul><li><p>When to start</p></li><li><p>How to sustain progress while delivering features</p></li><li><p>When to finish</p></li><li><p>Sometimes when to abandon ship</p></li></ul><p>You need to balance the perspectives of structure folks and feature folks, navigate power differentials, and maintain team cohesion even as you reshape the code.</p><p>Most importantly, we've seen that the simple models from <em>Tidy First?</em> need elaboration at scale. Power laws dominate, making our bell-curve intuitions actively harmful. Options interact in complex ways—a bundle of options really is worth more than an option on a bundle. And underlying everything is survival, the prerequisite that makes all other value possible.</p><h2>Where We're Going</h2><p>In the chapters that follow, we'll point toward territories yet to explore. Each represents a frontier where software design meets a broader challenge:</p><p><strong>Business relationships</strong>: How do we heal the persistent rift between those who build software and those who fund it? Software design isn't just about making code easier to change—it's about creating shared understanding across organizational boundaries.</p><p><strong>Generative AI</strong>: As coding assistants proliferate, what happens to software design? These tools excel at generating features but struggle with structure. How do we harness their power without sacrificing the optionality that enables long-term value?</p><p><strong>Ethics and culture</strong>: What are our obligations as software designers? How do we build cultures that value both features and structure, that support both individual craftsmanship and collective progress?</p><p>These aren't separate topics—they're different facets of the same diamond. Each reflects the fundamental truth we keep returning to: software design is an exercise in human relationships.</p><h2>The Path Forward</h2><p>To progress, we need to get right with ourselves, get right with our tools and technology, and get right with each other. Ambitious? I hope not. Necessary? Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Getting right with ourselves</strong> means developing the judgment to know when to tidy, when to refactor, when to redesign, and when to leave well enough alone. It means building the discipline to work in small, safe steps even when we're tempted to leap. It means accepting that we're worth the investment in making our own work easier.</p><p><strong>Getting right with our tools and technology</strong> means seeing past the features to the structure underneath. It means understanding the forces that shape our systems—not just coupling and cohesion, but power laws and emergence and survival. It means using our tools wisely, whether they're refactoring IDEs or AI assistants.</p><p><strong>Getting right with each other</strong>—well, that's the hard one, isn't it? It means building trust through transparency. It means respecting different perspectives and skills. It means remembering that every line of code is written by a human for other humans, in service of still other humans.</p><h2>One More Time</h2><p>Software design is an exercise in human relationships. If you take nothing else from these books, take that. Every design decision affects someone. Every structural change creates ripples through a web of human connections. Every feature enabled or frustrated by our design touches real people with real needs.</p><p>The techniques matter. The theory matters. But they matter because they help us serve each other better. They help us create software that not only works today but can grow and adapt tomorrow. They help us build systems that create value while preserving the humanity of everyone involved.</p><p>Ready for the final insights? Let's see where this journey leads us next.</p>
