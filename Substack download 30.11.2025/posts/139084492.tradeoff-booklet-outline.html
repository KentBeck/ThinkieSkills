<p>I’m not a big fan of outlining a book first. I’m always going to learn something while writing that will change the outline.</p><p>Fortunately, I’ve been thinking about &amp; writing about tradeoffs for a long time. I still expect to learn a lot in the process of writing, but not so much so as to invalidate the outline. So, to share a sense of where we are all going, here is a map.</p><ol><li><p>Roots—how I started thinking in terms of tradeoffs. (You’ve already received this but I’ll add more to the story.)</p></li><li><p>Cost—I usually tradeoff think in terms of reducing cost, not increasing revenue or profit. I’m not sure why this is. I hope I’ll find out while writing this.</p></li><li><p>Control—tradeoff think tries to find the setting for a single control that results in an acceptable cost. (Multiple controls need different Thinkies.)</p></li><li><p>Response curve—the response curve to the control needs to be non-linear or the problem is boring.</p></li><li><p>Threshold—this is the “acceptable” in “acceptable cost”. We want to avoid over-optimization, so knowing our limits help.</p></li><li><p>Counter curve—this is where the tradeoff comes in, and a real revelation to folks who’ve been trying to maximize.</p></li><li><p>Sum—it’s the interaction of the two curves that shapes the space we’re navigating.</p></li><li><p>Acceptable region—put the sum &amp; the threshold together &amp; you have the range where acceptable answers lies.</p></li><li><p>Changing curves—for me this is the boss move in tradeoff think. If we want the cost to change, we don’t just change the control, we change one or both of the curves &amp; let the system settle down.</p></li><li><p>Summed curve—now we get into rarer advanced topics. Sometimes it helps to view one of the response curves as the sum of multiple curves.</p></li><li><p>Profit—if we want to optimize profit, we have to look at a cost tradeoff &amp; a revenue tradeoff. I hardly ever do this, but it’s a useful trick to stretch tradeoff think.</p></li></ol><p>Looking at this list, some of these topics hardly seem worth a paragraph, much less 10 or 20. That’s what book writing is for me, the fractal explosion of an idea. I’m so glad you’re coming along for this. I’m starting to understand that this community of folks paying to subscribe is a safe place for me to expose ideas sooner than I otherwise would have. More feedback, quicker &amp; better results. Thank you for being part of it! </p>
