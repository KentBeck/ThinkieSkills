<p>We’ve mentioned that one of the fruits of working in The Forest is that you’ll see lots of experiments. Folks will try lots of ideas (carefully, in reversible ways) &amp; discard them because:</p><ul><li><p>They didn’t work, in the sense of not having the desired outcome (change in user behavior) or impact (profit)</p></li><li><p>They worked, but the externalities were too large<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p></li><li><p>They worked, but they turned out to violate some larger principle</p></li></ul><p>The Forest encourages experiments:</p><ul><li><p>Everyone acknowledges that foreknowledge is impossible</p></li><li><p>There is enough time, so failure (in the above sense) isn’t disaster</p></li><li><p>Everyone acknowledges that learning is value in itself</p></li></ul><h2>Failure <em>Is</em> An Option</h2><p>I presented 3X: Explore/Expand/Extract to someone at one of the AI rockets the other day. Something they said caught my ear—”We have Explores that can’t fail.” Pardon me? That’s not a thing.</p><p>Saying that an Explore can’t fail reveals a misunderstanding of the nature of risk &amp; how to address it. Take the case of a service that needs to scale 100X (in this Yule season I wish us all problems like this). If we fail to scale our service in time, there will be significant business consequences—slower growth, difficulty raising the next round of financing, fewer eventual customers.</p><p>And we don’t know how exactly to scale our service 100X. Some things we know are bottlenecks. Other things we’re sure we’ll discover are bottlenecks.</p><p>It’s tempting to call this project an Explore, because the risks are high—both the risk of big learnings that delay the project, the risk of the consequences, &amp; the risk of outright failure. But it’s not an Explore.</p><h2>Expand</h2><p>The phases (Explore/Expand/Extract) derive from the risks we face. The big risk in Explore is that nobody cares. That’s why we put stuff out there quickly until something makes a difference to a customer. Our Service 100X project does not have the risk that nobody cares. People care <em>a lot</em> about Service 100X. People even care a little too much for comfort. But hey, this is the price for success.</p><p>What we have is an Expand project—high risk of failure, high risk of consequential learning, high cost of delay (really high), high risk of interruption by an even higher priority disaster-in-the-making. But also high value for success.</p><p>“An Expand that can’t fail,” makes sense (even though it <em>can</em> fail).</p><p>Expand is where the money is made in development. Successful Expands are tomorrow’s profitable Extracts. And Expand has its own rules that are different than Explore or Extract:</p><ul><li><p>Know your next bottleneck. Find your rate limiting resource. Graph supply &amp; demand to determine the deadline (this time with actual death). Don’t solve problems ahead.</p></li><li><p>Shed load. Delete non-essential features. Throttle load (better than crashing).</p></li><li><p>Be intense, but smart about it. You may work unsustainable hours for a month or two. Don’t make it a habit. It backfires.</p></li><li><p>Good enough is good enough. Stop addressing this bottleneck as soon as supply &amp; demand curves no longer intersect.</p></li><li><p>Throw money. Legit approach (until money becomes the rate limiting resource).</p></li><li><p>Integration wins. Integrate <em>more</em> often. Collaborate <em>more</em>. Deploy <em>more</em>. You’re in a land of unknowns.</p></li></ul><p>As the Expand project begins, yes, you are going to have Explore sub-projects. That’s fine. But if any of them can’t fail, you’re wedged.</p><h2>Ergodicity</h2><p>Explore-in-Expand reminds me of Ergodicity by <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Luca Dellanna&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:7012085,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce2ffe3f-ad8e-4c41-a542-87167a4f0c4c_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;f2cb37f2-5c93-442f-a9b7-fba942d8880b&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>. To improve the survivability of a large-scale goal, reduce the survival of sub-goals. If I have a sub-goal that can’t fail without taking down the whole goal, I’m at big risk. If I restructure the goal so that any 1 of 3-4 subgoals needs to succeed, I’m much safer (this is what I’m doing with my career right now).</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Working on Meta Messenger, at the end of the review period there would always be a bunch of features launched to 100%, features that shared the same screen real estate. That real estate became cluttered to the point that it was almost unusable. 1) This blunted the effect of every one of those features &amp; 2) someone would take as their task for the <em>next</em> review period to de-clutter the UI. Cue “The Circle of Life”.</p></div></div>
