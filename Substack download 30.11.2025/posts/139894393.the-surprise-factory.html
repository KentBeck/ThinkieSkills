Here is my latest idea.</p><p>There is one kind of software business where the steady accumulation of small features results in small increases in profit. Software design is valuable as a way of reducing the cost of that stream of features. Software design has small incremental value for these businesses.</p><p>Another kind of software business takes advantage of surprises. Surprises from:</p><ul><li><p>The market—who is buying &amp; for what purpose.</p></li><li><p>Implementation—what is expensive &amp; cheap to implement.</p></li><li><p>Use—how customers actually use the product.</p></li></ul><p>Surprise-rich environments are where software design shines. Or rather, where the lack of software design hurts most. Churning out features at maximum rates reduces the chance that you’ll notice the opportunity for a surprise &amp; reduces the chance that your team will be able to capitalize when a surprise pops up.</p><h2>Surprise Factory</h2><p>Creating &amp; maintaining the Surprise Factory is part of the executive’s job, not in the sense of creating options in the code, but in creating incentives to balance features today with options tomorrow:</p><ul><li><p>Hiring people who can maintain that balance.</p></li><li><p>Celebrating successful surprises.</p></li><li><p>Celebrating cheap unsuccessful surprises.</p></li><li><p>Articulating &amp; maintaining the long-term vision within which those surprises happen.</p></li></ul><p>The goal, in this story, is to make every day Christmas. Create conditions in which something unexpected can appear under the tree. Regularly.</p><p>Does that sound like something worthy of an executive’s time, money, &amp; attention?</p>
