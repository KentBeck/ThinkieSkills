<p>Another project-related Thinkie: make feedback personal.</p><p>When I worked at Gusto, although we sold a payroll service we didn’t use Gusto to pay ourselves. In the very early days we had paid ourselves with our own system, but as Gusto grew we decided that keeping up with our own growth would be too distracting.</p><p>Here’s the thing—yes, it would have been “distracting” from what we thought we should do, but it also cut us off from valuable feedback &amp; emotional energy for development. How serious are you going to take quality if you own paycheck is on the line?</p><p>Pattern: there’s a system worked on by another system.</p><p>Transformation: use the system on itself.</p><p>I can think of so many great stories supporting this Thinkie.</p><ul><li><p>The optimizing compiler that was slower than the previous compiler except that when you ran the optimizing compiler on itself the result was much faster.</p></li><li><p>I once terrified an engineering director at a networking company by suggesting that the daily build of their router software should be installed on their own internal routers every night.</p></li></ul><p>We’ll talk about ergodicity in good time, but I’ll point out here that this Thinkie is an example of the Skin In The Game principle.</p>
