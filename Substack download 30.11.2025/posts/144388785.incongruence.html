<p>Next up are a couple of consulting Thinkies. Consulting, which I have recently gotten back into (contact me for deets!)</p><div class="directMessage button" data-attrs="{&quot;userId&quot;:24333739,&quot;userName&quot;:&quot;Kent Beck&quot;,&quot;canDm&quot;:null,&quot;dmUpgradeOptions&quot;:null,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}" data-component-name="DirectMessageToDOM"></div><p>provides an interesting set of constraints. I typically have a short period in which to observe, orient, decide, &amp; communicate. I don’t have time to develop deep relationships, limiting what I can say &amp; how I can say it. I don’t have time to dig deep, limiting the quality &amp; quantity of my ideas. I don’t have time to deliver a series of messages, so the first thing I say had better have impact. I don’t even have time to try out variations on my message. How can I say something useful, actionable, palatable in the time I have.</p><p>Pattern: something about the story doesn’t add up, but you can’t put your finger on what.</p><p>Transformation: let go trying to figure it out. Find a spot where the words don’t match the actions &amp; surface it.</p><p>Okay, please please please use this Thinkie with care. This is a very spectrum-y way of looking at work/social situations. There are subtle &amp; powerful ways of pointing out incongruence. I don’t have access to those techniques. I rely on being blunt-but-trustworthy. Some people can listen to that. Many can’t.</p><p>The Thinkie Incongruence is not an excuse to be an asshole. You’re being paid <em>a lot</em> for your expertise. Saying what you have to say in the most hear-able way is part of that expertise. But when taking in a whole complicated, history-rich, multi-faceted situation, oriented on where words &amp; actions contradict helps you narrow your focus.</p><p>The problem with incongruence is the energy it requires. You have to keep saying what you’re saying even though you know it doesn’t match. You have to keep doing what you’re doing even while it bothers you that your actions don’t match your words. When freed either to match actions to words or words to actions, your client discovers a new source of energy.</p><p></p>
