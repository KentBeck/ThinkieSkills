<p>Pattern: progress is blocked by a dependency on another project/team/organization/company.</p><p>Transformation: merge, temporarily or permanently, whole or in part, the 2 entities</p><p>Sometimes a blocking dependency is just the universe telling you that you have the wrong organization. What would a reorganization look like that would eliminate the dependency?</p><p>The simplest, smallest version of dependency merging is fostering—second 1 or 2 folks to work with the other organization (or welcome 1 or 2 of their folks). More formally you can organize a task force with a single, task-oriented focus. At larger scales you merge them completely, up to &amp; including buying a vendor or customer.</p>
