<p>What do you do when coupling is costing you dear but decoupling is impossible (or just too expensive)? Apply coupling’s flip side—cohesion.</p><p>Cohesion is a measure of how coupled the <em>inside </em>of an element is. And, this is the hard part, the more coupled the better.</p><p>Wait, I thought you just said that coupling was bad, that coupling magnified cost. How is more coupling inside of an element good?</p><p>This is one of those "compared to what?" questions. More cohesion is better because the alternative is to have the same coupling spread all over the system.</p><p>Take the box of gears from the previous chapter. Would you rather have all the connected gears be in one box or scattered across a bunch of boxes? If all the coupled gears are in one box, then the cost growth that spoils the Surprise Factory is limited. The friction to change can only get so bad.</p><p>Taking coupling that is spread out &amp; putting it all in one place is progress in software design.</p><h2><strong>Cohesion: The Art of Contained Change</strong></h2><p>The ideal design enables one feature to be implemented by one change to the code. Coupling doesn’t stick its nose in. Change doesn’t propagate. However, completely eliminating coupling is often a daunting, if not impossible, task. The pragmatic approach, then, is to limit the extent of change, much like containing a virus during a pandemic.</p><p>There are two parts to cohesion:</p><ul><li><p>All the elements that change together sit together. All the functions that have to change at the same time (are coupled) sit in the same file.</p></li><li><p>All elements that change at other times sit somewhere else (preferably at a lunch table with the other elements that change simultaneously).</p></li></ul><p>Cohering a system, increasing the cohesion of its elements, is almost always possible. Unlike decoupling, which can require a stroke of insight to see, cohering is a simpler structural change. A &amp; B changed at the same time? Do we put A with B, B with A, or the two of them together in some new spot?</p><h2><strong>Cohesion Leads to Decoupling</strong></h2><p>Increasing cohesion doesn’t just mitigate the cost of coupling; it often serves as a stepping stone towards eventually eliminating coupling. In the short run you’ve reduced the cost of change. By organizing the system into cohesive units, we pave the way for more significant structural improvements down the line. Those strokes of insight come more readily to those who’ve done the work.</p><h2><strong>Economic Implications of Cohesion</strong></h2><p>Cohesion enhances the Net Present Value (NPV) of software by reducing the cost and time associated with changes. Fewer resources are needed to implement changes, and they can be deployed faster, accelerating revenue generation.</p><p>That NPV improvement needs to be traded off against the cost of cohering (increasing cohesion). Unlike decoupling however, which can spread without limit, cohering tends to stay limited in scope.</p><p>Furthermore, the second-order economic effect of improving cohesion expands the software’s optionality. With lower change costs, a broader spectrum of alterations becomes economically feasible. Lowering the cost of changes maintains the Surprise Factory. Inproving the structure of the system enhances its value, allowing for a continuous stream of innovations and improvements.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: Tying Together Cohesion and Coupling</strong></h2><p>Managing coupling &amp; cohesion is not just a technical challenge but also an economic strategy. By investing in the structure of software, we’re not merely improving its current state; we’re enhancing its future potential and value. Cohesion, in tandem with coupling, forms the foundation for building economically viable and adaptable software systems.</p><p>So why aren’t teams already investing in structure? In the next chapter, we delve into the incentive structures within software development organizations. These incentives often impede investment in software structure, favoring short-term gains over long-term sustainability. We’ll explore how you can realign these incentives to support not just the immediate functionality of software but its enduring economic and strategic value.</p>
