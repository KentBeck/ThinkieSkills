<p>My plan was to begin writing Tidy 2 right away. My brain has other ideas. I wrote the first <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/thinkie-tradeoff">tradeoff-related Thinkie</a>, then I started thinking about tradeoffs, then I started thinking more about tradeoffs…</p><p>Turns our there’s far more to tradeoffs than I’ve realized, in spite of using them for 50+ years. There’s an underlying structure, biases, refinements, application, use, &amp; abuse. So, just to get this stuff out of my head I’m going to share it with you, my supportive readers. I don’t know if this turns into a book, a $3 Kindle Direct Publishing booklet, TikToks, graphic novel, a comic opera, or what. I just know it  needs to get out of my head.</p><p>Expect the first chapter on Monday, with a new chapter every Monday until my brain is cleared. Please apply, comment, give me examples (examples are the hardest part of writing), counterexamples (counterexamples are the best source of new thinking), teach it, let me know how that goes.</p><p>I’m going to write it in the order I’m thinking it, which is not necessarily the order optimized for reading. It’s going to start out abstract &amp; then get more detailed. That’s because I’m trying to dig in &amp; understand the underlying structure.</p><p>I’m a little nervous, truth be told, because this is a kind of pure “thinking about thinking” that I find deeply satisfying. So satisfying that I’m a bit suspicious. What if I’m operating at an abstract level to avoid messy reality? And yet, this is what my brain does so I’d better let it do its do.</p><p>Thinkies are still coming on their regular Tuesday cadence, just non-tradeoff related ones.</p><p>Again &amp; always, thank you for supporting me in this kind of intellectual exploration. I love being on a journey together with you.</p>
