<p>You know that moment when you're reading some code &amp; you say, "Oh, so <em>_that's_</em> what's going on!" That's a valuable moment. Record it.</p><p></p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Write down only what wasn't obvious from the code. Put yourself in the place of the future reader or yourself 15 minutes ago. What is it that you would like to have known? "The following is complicated by the need to reduce the number of network calls as much as possible."</p><p>Write to someone specific, even if they aren't much like you. Are you the only biologist on your team of computer scientists? Then you'd better explain any biology context in the code, even if it would be obvious to you.</p><p>Immediately upon finding a defect is a good time to comment. "Be sure to change ../foo if you add another case." It's not ideal to have that coupling in your code &amp; eventually we're going to learn how to eliminate it but for now it's much better to have the comment pointing out the coupling than leaving the coupling buried just under the sand.</p>
