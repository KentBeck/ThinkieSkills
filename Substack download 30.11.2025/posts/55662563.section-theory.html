<p>(Now that the vacation and the COVID are over I’m back to writing. Looking forward to hearing what you think about the next section, the section on theory. This is the part that most excites me, because I love deeply understanding topics. We’ll see how widely shared this obsession is.)</p><p>Now that we've seen <em>what</em> to tidy &amp; <em>how</em> to tidy we can discuss <em>why</em> to tidy. You don't need to know exactly how a medication works to experience its effects, but knowing how it works gives you a deeper appreciation of it &amp; allows you to use the medication in novel circumstances.</p><p>Theory doesn't convince. No one is going to say, "Tidying is bullshit. Oh, wait, you're creating optionality. I guess it's a good idea after all."</p><p>Understanding theory optimizes application. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>The forever questions in software design are:</p><ul><li><p>When do I start making software design decisions?</p></li><li><p>When do I stop making software design decisions &amp; get on with changing the behavior of the system?</p></li><li><p>How do I make the next decision?</p></li></ul><p>These questions aren't rationally, logically answerable because the information needed to find rational, logical answers doesn't exist when we ask the questions.<br>Understanding theory sharpens your judgement for when you have to answer these questions on speculation.</p><p>This book is primarily focused on your relationship with yourself--do you value yourself enough to make your work easier before you do the work. This is only step one on the journey of "software design is an exercise in human relationships".</p><p>Understanding theory lets you disagree constructively with your fellow geeks.<br>Sometimes when I want to do X and you want to do Y, what we disagree about is simple. We are both trying to accomplish the same goal but in different ways. Theory helps when our disagreement runs deeper, which we are trying to accomplish different goals. This is when sharing a theoretical framework becomes valuable.<br>If we disagree in principle &amp; we can discuss our principles, then we have a chance to agree on what to do sooner. We also have a chance to learn from each other. When we're stuck on "X," "No, Y," then we're stuck in a battle of wills, likely to be resolved through our relative power positions in our relationship.</p><p>In this section, we'll discuss:</p><ol><li><p>What <em>is</em> software design?</p></li><li><p>How does software design drive the cost of software development &amp; operation?</p></li><li><p>What are the tradeoffs between investing in the structure of software &amp; not investing in the structure of software?</p></li><li><p>What principles, economic &amp; human, can you use to inform whether &amp; how to change the structure of software?</p></li></ol><p>First, what is software design?</p>
