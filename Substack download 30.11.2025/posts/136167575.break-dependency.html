<p>Pattern: Your project can’t progress because you’re waiting on another project/team/organization/company.</p><p>Transformation: Break the dependency. What would happen if you did just enough work yourself?</p><p>In the name of efficiency we build elaborate structures of dependencies, never noticing that these lilliputian threads tie us down. The small gains because of decreased redundant work are devoured by the enormous losses because of increased thumb twiddling.</p><p>Instead of waiting for <em>them</em>, just do the work you’re waiting for yourself. Maybe go into <em>their</em> system &amp; do the work (this can be a political minefield, but it’s an idea). Maybe build your own system that does just enough for your needs.</p><p>I learned a harsh lesson about dependency breaking and my own privilege a few years back. Over lunch a woman engineer told me how blocked her team was because a system they depended on was unreliable. I suggested dependency breaking—just build her own version of the (bloated) system she depended on.</p><p>Another woman engineer at the table, “If I did that, I would never get another code change approved as long as I worked here.” I was astounded. Why not?</p><p>Because the owners of the “spurned” system would sabotage her work as revenge. I couldn’t believe such things happen. Talking to other women engineers, though, they all reported some variant of this story.</p><p>So be careful with dependency breaking. It generates ideas. Whether they are good ideas in your exact context you will have to figure out for yourself.</p>
