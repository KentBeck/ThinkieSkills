<p>Let's say you've just read a file (we can have the debate about whether source code belongs in files some other day). You've read the file &amp; you get to the end &amp; there it is!, the detail what would have helped you understand all the rest of the file.</p><p>Re-order the code in the file in the order in which a reader (remember, there are many readers for each writer) would prefer to encounter it.</p><p></p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>You're a reader. You just read. So you know.</p><p>Resist the temptation to apply any other tidying at the same time. Likely in reading you will have found other details that make comprehension &amp; change harder than they should be. There will be time for those details later. Either that or tidy those detail and shuffle into reading order in a later tidying. Don't mix.</p><p>Some languages [which?] are sensitive to the order of declaration of elements. That is, switching the order of declaring function A &amp; function B will result in different execution results. Be careful in such languages. Maybe don't reorder the whole file, just the bits most relevant for readers.</p><p>No single ordering of elements is perfect. Sometimes you want to understand the primitives first &amp; then understand how they compose. Sometimes you want to understand the API first &amp; then understand the details of implementation. You're the reader, use your judgement &amp; (recent) experience. What order would you have liked to encounter? Give the gift of that sequence to the next reader.</p>
