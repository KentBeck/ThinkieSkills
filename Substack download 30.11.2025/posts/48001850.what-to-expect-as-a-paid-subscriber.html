<p>This is my first time running a paid newsletter, so all of what follows is up for discussion.</p><p>I expect you as a reader to come here wanting to improve your software design skills. At the end of a year or so there should be a book you can buy to help you get started. You don’t want to wait that long, so you’re paying for early access to the book as it is being written. By being involved all along you also have a chance to get your specific questions answered by the book instead of just contenting yourself with the generic questions I compile. Finally, you’ll meet here a group of fellow software design enthusiasts, with all the benefits (and challenges) that implies.</p><p>Expect to see about 1000 words per week from me. If I do that for 50 weeks I’ll have a book. And you’ll have a book. (I’ll figure out how to release a book free to paid subscribers by then, along with probably a gilt-edged parchment edition.)</p><p>Expect experiments in using this medium to talk about software design—guest case studies, private video-based events, maybe a San Francisco-based meetup (plague willing). Also, if you stay as a free subscriber, expect experiments in how much/often free material appears. I’d like you to be getting value from this channel too.</p>
