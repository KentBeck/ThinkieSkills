<p>Now we've seen several decisions operating as trade-offs. More generally what kind of decisions are we talking about?</p><p>Because of the use of graphics in visualizing trade-offs, you might imagine that we're looking for a mathematically precise or data-informed decision. We are not. That is the realm of operations research &amp; they are welcome to it. Mostly, when I seek mathematical rigor, I'm making the mistake of trying to squeeze certainty out of an uncertain world.</p><p>My goal with trade-off thinking is to better inform my intuition. I want to make gut decisions, but with fewer of the mistakes that come with having a human brain.</p><p>The first contribution to my thinking comes with having to be explicit about what cost I'm trying to minimize or benefit I'm trying to maximize. Again, I'm not trying to be mathematically precise. The world is a far more complicated place than can be captured in one diagram. However, I can only address so many issues at one time. I will often struggle to articulate what exactly the cost is and that struggle is part of the thinking value of working with trade-offs.</p><p>The second contribution is recognizing that there's a goal past which further improvement is not at the moment useful. This lets me reduce the scope of my problem-solving to something that I can reasonably handle. Reduced scope reduces the chance that I will fall into despair at facing an impossible task.</p><p>The third contribution comes from recognizing that just pushing harder isn't going to get me to my goal. Pushing harder is always within my control and so that's what I fall back on as a strategy.</p><p>The fourth contribution comes from making fewer mistakes. I want to avoid pushing harder when I’ve reached diminishing returns &amp; especially when I'm now actually harming my own goal. I want to avoid operating at the wrong level of abstraction. We will see many examples later where changing the shape of the curves is the most valuable response to a trade-off decision situation.</p><p>So, we're in a complex situation, where the connection between cause and effect isn't perfectly clear, we have unsatisfied goals, and we have the freedom to choose how we will meet those goals. Trade-offs let us navigate this situation with fewer gross errors and more behavior that is effective at the appropriate level.</p><p>Next, we will study the anatomy of a tradeoff.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
