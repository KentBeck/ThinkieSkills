<p>This one goes in the “ideas are a dime a dozen” bucket. I want my phone to adapt to whether I am wearing glasses or not. Fonts should get bigger. Layouts should adjust to show fewer, larger items.</p><p>Designing &amp; coding all this by hand would be incredibly tedious, error-prone, &amp; expensive. Look, I can’t even get native iPad apps for most of the apps I use.</p><p>Idea: instead of current layouts frameworks, specify layouts in terms of what you want accomplished:</p><ul><li><p>This text is a caption for that picture.</p></li><li><p>These items go together as a single item.</p></li><li><p>This item has comments.</p></li><li><p>This item has reactions.</p></li><li><p>This is a form to be filled out.</p></li></ul><p>The pixel-precise layout is done with a constraint solver or magic AI pixie dust or whatever.</p><p>Imagine I’m doom-scrolling my Feed of News. I take off my glasses. The screen changes layout so I can still read. I put my glasses back on. Back to the original.</p><p>Once you have layouts specified semantically instead of geographically, you can really turn up the magic AI pixie dust. You can gradually evolve better &amp; better layouts. You can personalize layouts. Maybe I react better to captions at the top &amp; you react better to captions at the bottom. Why shouldn’t we each get what’s best for us?</p><p>The way to get started on this new framework would be to build one specific app using it. Only add elements &amp; relationships as needed. Begin adapting to re-layout signals from the very beginning. That’s the magical demo.</p><p>Anyway, I’m not going to work on this but I hope someone does.</p>
