<blockquote><p>It feels weird to publish a chapter from a different book. I’ll get back to Tidy Together? presently, but I also want to finish this executive briefing. Work in process, dontcha know. Again, please read &amp; comment with your executive hat on.</p><p>Finally, I’ve changed the title to The Present Factory. “Surprise” just had too many ways to interpret negatively. Thoughts?</p></blockquote><p>Software design—the art &amp; science of structuring software to contain and reduce costs—is undoubtedly necessary. There’s debate about <em>when</em>, but none about <em>whether</em>. However, design often takes a backseat to the development of new features. This chapter delves into why this imbalance exists. You can leverage your power to create a more effective incentive structure, balancing features &amp; design &amp; preserving the Present Factory.</p><p>&lt;[cartoon of product and engineering having a tug of war]&gt;</p><h2><strong>Why Features Often Eclipse Design</strong></h2><p>Features are visible &amp; direct:</p><ul><li><p>Legible. Users &amp; stakeholders can see &amp; understand features. They are the flashy, front-stage performers in the software show, immediately attracting attention.</p></li><li><p>Direct impact on user experience. Features directly change how users interact with the software, often leading to immediate, observable outcomes. This visibility attracts investment.</p></li><li><p>Cash flow—revenue or costs. Features should be linked to revenue generation or cost reduction, making them attractive from a business standpoint. They are the low-hanging fruit of financial returns in software development.</p></li><li><p>Organizational comprehensibility. Features are straightforward to explain across the organization, from sales to marketing, enhancing their appeal in strategic discussions.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>The Underappreciated Value of Design</strong></h2><p>In contrast, structural changes in software are subtler and more complex:</p><ul><li><p>Direct appreciation limited to developers. The benefits of structural changes are often appreciated only by programmers. Phrases like “lower coupling” &amp; "higher cohesion" sound abstract to non-technical stakeholders and don’t resonate with immediate business value.</p></li><li><p>Deferred and uncertain payoff. The advantages of design improvements are realized in the future and are not always predictable. This uncertainty makes them less appealing compared to the immediate gains from new features.</p></li><li><p>Rework. Refining the structure can feel like rectifying past errors. “Why wasn’t it designed right from the start?” The previous structure wasn’t a mistake—it kept the system alive, it reflected the needs of the system in its context (exploring or expanding), &amp; now that context has changed.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Balancing Today’s Features with Tomorrow’s Flexibility</strong></h2><p>&lt;hauling a safe full of money up a cliff&gt;<br>As an executive, your role is maintaining the Present Factory by balancing the demand for new features with the need for improving design. You help preserve the software’s option value, ensuring the system remains adaptable and efficient in the long run, while continuing to improve NPV.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that neither Business nor Technology can exist alone. They are like lichen, two species inextricably entwined. When they forget that they are on the same side, it’s your job to remind both parties. Forcefully, if necessary.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Present Factory Requires a Balanced Approach</strong></h2><p>Understanding and addressing this incentive paradox is crucial for long-term software success. Executives must champion the cause of design, advocating for its importance alongside feature development. At the same time, executives need to push back on short-sighted attempts to stop all feature development &amp; focus solely on structure for extended periods.</p><p>Your story telling sets tone for the organization. Celebrate features that make a difference to the business but also celebrate the software design that keeps the Present Factory humming. When a feature that used to take error-prone weeks to complete now takes hours, tell that story around the campfire. When design changes seemed like they would shut down feature development for weeks or months but your team figures out how to make those changes while continuing to deliver features, reward the team with more autonomy &amp; bigger challenges.</p><p>In the final chapter, we’ll explore guiding principles and common pitfalls to avoid as you preserve the Present Factory by balancing investment between features and design. This balance is not just about creating immediate value but also about fostering sustainable, adaptable software development that continues to deliver happy surprises.</p>
