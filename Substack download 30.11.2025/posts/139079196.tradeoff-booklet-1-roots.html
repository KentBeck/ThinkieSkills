<p>I want the world to make sense. The roots of my obsession go back to a chaotic childhood. If only I could figure out <em>why</em> the adults in my life acted this way, then I’d know what was coming next &amp; maybe I could do something about it.</p><p>One manifestation of my obsession with getting things to make sense was reading. My interest in programming started when my father, an engineer, would bring home technical manuals from the computers he was working on. Buried deep in my psyche are details of the stack-oriented Burroughs 6700 architecture.</p><p>My reading habit led me down many other rabbit holes: African big game hunting, military history, biographies, mythology &amp; folklore, science ficture. Lots &amp; lots of science fiction. Even now as I’m remembering this to write it down I’m mentally navigating the stacks of the Sunnyvale Public Library.</p><p>One book I picked up at random was about the philosophy of engineering. The book made a big deal out of the difference between <em>maximization</em> &amp; <em>optimization</em>. I remember thinking, “But they’re the same,” as I read it. Still, the book disagreed. I was interested enough to check the book out 3 times in a row, just to try to understand their point. This was my first introduction to thinking in tradeoffs.</p><p>You’ve been reading Thinkies for a while now, so you know I’m interested in thinking-about-thinking (meta-cognition). I believe that many of my ideas that others deem “creative” come not from a mystic brow-touch from The Muse, but from a collection of habits of thought.</p><p>I haven’t really dug into any of the Thinkies I’ve presented to date, offering them instead as a “when you see <em>this</em> trying thinking <em>that</em>”, along with an example or two. This booklet is the first time I’ve dug into the structure behind a Thinkie.</p><p>Tradeoffs are the first step beyond linear thinking. When more or less of <em>this</em> leads to more or less of <em>that</em>, then you can navigate without thinking too hard. What do you do when those simple relationships break down? Tradeoffs are a start, leading to second-order effect, reinforcing &amp; inhibiting loops, thresholds, &amp; the whole panoply of systems thinking. We’re not going there, not in this book. In this book we’ll take tradeoffs apart &amp; put them back together.</p><p>I invite you to pass through this door with me. I can’t walk you through the lands beyond, but from here on the threshold we can glimpse some notable features you will surely encounter as you think your own thinking.</p>
