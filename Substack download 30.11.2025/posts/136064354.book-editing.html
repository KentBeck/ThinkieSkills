<p>I received the technical feedback for <em>Tidy First?</em> on May 22 (I just checked). I didn’t touch the book until last week. Two months of nothing.</p><p>It’s not that there’s so much work to do. I’m nearly done with this round of edits (I still have copy-editing to go). It’s the emotional impact of editing that gets to me.</p><p>My sleep is disrupted. My skin is breaking out. My partner is commenting on my changed behavior. This is not good.</p><h2>Request</h2><p>The good news is that I’m almost done. The only big chunk I have left to do is I would like to include examples of <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/reading-order">Reading Order</a> &amp; <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/cohesion-order">Cohesion Order</a>. I don’t have recent examples &amp; I haven’t been able to find good candidates for re-ordering on GitHub in a few hours. If you want eternal fame or at least a mention in the acknowledgements, send me a PR applying one of these tidyings to an open source project. But it’ll have to be soon because I can’t do this much longer.</p><h2>Question</h2><p>I’m summarizing the planned Empirical Software Design series of books. I laid out the 3 books row-wise &amp; column-wise &amp; I can’t decide which one I like better. If you have a preference, please respond in the comments.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png" width="678" height="516" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:516,&quot;width&quot;:678,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61754,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V0O8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b008b08-8d57-4f71-a01b-57e49be6c3cb_678x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Why?</h2><p>The personal growth question is, “Why does editing bother me so much?” Of my 8 books, I think this is the best I’ve ever done with this phase of book writing &amp; it’s awful. But what’s my deal?</p><p>Losing control is one of my biggest fears. Actually publishing a book is the ultimate loss of control. All of those words are stuck there on that page <em>forever</em>. Well, not forever, just for a few years that they are relevant. And not infinitely many copies, just a few thousand copies if I’m lucky. And only the physical books are unchangeable.</p><p>What I’m confronting is the fear that my words will be misused. I spoke at an Agile Africa event &amp; had someone come up to me &amp; say, “I just want to talk to users &amp; program. All this ‘agile’ stuff is getting in the way of that.” I burst into tears. I wanted users to know that they mattered &amp; programmers to know that they mattered &amp; what I had written was being used to squash them both.</p><p>I think I need to accept this. Some people will get nothing from what I write. Others will take what I write &amp; learn &amp; grow. And others will take what I write &amp; use it to oppress others. I can’t control how people use what I publish.</p><p>I can control how clearly &amp; carefully I think before &amp; as I write. I can control how clearly I express myself. I can control how honestly I see my own intentions. That’s it. The rest is up to y’all.</p><p>I cost myself 2 months out of the next book stewing on this. Okay. I can’t get those 2 months back. I can finish the bits &amp; bobs I have left. So that’s what I’m going to do now. Peace, friends.</p><h2>Discounts</h2><p>To thank you all for your support &amp; feedback during the writing process I will have a discount code for you to order <em>Tidy First?</em> when it officially appears (the draft is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tidy-first/9781098151232/">already available</a>). More on that when the book is released in October.</p>
