<p>Here we have the economic tug-of-war that makes "Tidy First?" such an interesting question:</p><ul><li><p>Discounted cash flow tells us to make money sooner with greater likelihood &amp; spend money later with less likelihood. Don't tidy first. That's spending money sooner &amp; earning money later. Maybe don't even tidy after or later.</p></li><li><p>Options tells us to spend money now to make more money later (even if we don't currently know exactly how). Absolutely tidy first (when it creates options). Tidy after &amp; later too.</p></li></ul><p>Tidy first? Yes. Also no.</p><p>Now there are times to tidy first for sure. When cost(tidying) + cost(behavior change after tidying) &lt; cost(behavior change without tidying), then absolutely tidy first. It's still easy to get carried away &amp; tidy too much, but set &amp; maintain boundaries for how far you'll go and you'll be fine.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>The more fraught situations is when cost(tidying) + cost(behavior change after tidying) &gt; cost(behavior change without tidying). You might still want to tidy first, even though short term economics discourages you. You may be implementing a series of behavior changes, all of which benefit from the tidying. Amortizing the cost of the tidying across all the changes might make sense, even discounting the cash flows.</p><p>Tidying first may make economic sense in spite of discounted cash flows if the value of the options created is greater than the value lost by spending money sooner &amp; with certainty. We are firmly in the land of judgement here. Your sniffer might tell you, "There's more good stuff here but I need to tidy to be able to see it." That may be good enough evidence for more tidying.</p><p>Or, since software design is an exercise in human relationships and we're talking about our relationship with ourself here at the scale of tidying, you might tidy first just because it makes the subsequent behavior changes more pleasant. A little bit of this "tidying as self-care" is justified. Just recognize that you are going counter to your economic incentives.</p><p>At the scale of tidying--minutes to hours--we can't (&amp; shouldn't try to) precisely calculate the economics of our tidying. We are exercising 2 important forms of judgement, practicing for bigger things later:</p><ul><li><p>Getting used to being aware of the incentives affecting the timing &amp; scope of software design. "I want to spend more time designing &amp; I'm getting pushback. What's going on?"</p></li><li><p>Practicing on ourselves the relationship skills that we will later be using with our direct colleagues &amp; then our more distant colleagues.</p></li></ul><p>Once we raise the stakes, where the survival and thrival of a product is on the line, we'll be glad of a gut sense of when &amp; how to design &amp; when not to design.</p>
