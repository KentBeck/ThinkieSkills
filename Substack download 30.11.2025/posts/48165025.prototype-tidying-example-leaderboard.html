<p>We have our first tidying PR captured from the wild. Adrià Fontcuberta found a <a href="https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/pull/1102">good spot for a Guard Clause</a>. Congratulations!</p><p>If submitting example PRs starts getting popular, I’ll need to build a more technical system for folks to submit their examples. For the moment, and to prove the need for such a system, email them to me &amp; I’ll collect the examples in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PiynrFItJd1ULYVfhxHrq5aarCnOOR8-GoKSlbUCh6A/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a>.</p><p>If you apply a tidying, send it directly to me for now. If you don’t want it listed on the leaderboard, you don’t have. You can just brag to me and I’ll email you your gold star. If you’d like to use a nickname, that’s fine too.</p>
