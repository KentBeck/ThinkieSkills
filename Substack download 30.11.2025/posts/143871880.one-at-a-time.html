<p>Whatever principles I try to live &amp; work by, I try to apply them just as much &amp; as often as possible. Yesterday, though, a lawn chair taught me a valuable lesson about the principle of flow.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg" width="768" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:768,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;2 Patio Chairs - Matthews Auctioneers&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="2 Patio Chairs - Matthews Auctioneers" title="2 Patio Chairs - Matthews Auctioneers" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyBk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The Principle of Flow states that, all else being equal, smaller batches of value more frequently is worth more than that same value delivered in fewer, larger batches. You’ll find the Principle of Flow working every corner of Extreme Programming—software design, planning, testing, integration, deployment, conversations—every corner.</p><h2>Lawn Chairs</h2><p>Back to the lawn chairs &amp; my obsession about principles. I was getting 2 chairs out of the box in which they shipped. First I said, “I’ll get grab one first because that will be easier.” Followed quickly by, “Hey, this is the Principle of Flow. Aren’t I a good boy to be applying my principles throughout my life? Talk about integrity!”</p><p>Followed by 10 minutes of thumping &amp; swearing. Every time I moved the top chair, the bottom chair would shift. The shift deformed the cardboard box (which I couldn’t destroy), causing the top chair to be more firmly stuck. (At this point a diagram would likely help, but that seems overkill for the eventual conclusion—trust me that moving one chair caused that chair, indirectly, to be more stuck.)</p><p>Principled action can be extremely expensive if you’re dumb about it.</p><p>Eventually I thought, “Well, I wonder if I can shift the bottom chair?” One tug &amp; both chairs popped right out.</p><p>More obscenities. Okay, what just went on here? What was wrong with my principles or my interpretation of my principles?</p><h2>One [X] At A Time</h2><p>The problem is that tricky phrase, “…all else being equal…”. In this case, 1 chair at a time wasn’t at all equal to 2 chairs at a time. 1 chair at a time caused nearly infinite friction, infinite at least from the perspective of my aching back. 2 chairs at a time had no friction, just the (light) weight of the chairs.</p><p>The bigger batch <em>reduced</em> effort. That may be the rare case. Incentives abound to thoughtlessly increase batch size. I don’t want to make a habit of increasing batch sizes when I encounter trouble. But I need to be aware of the twin possibilities of increasing &amp; decreasing batch size. I need to be prepared to solve for X in “One X at a time”.</p><p>(The other lesson is about hubris. Just because I have <em>some</em> principles that seem to work in <em>most</em> situations, I don’t have it all figured out. I need to observe, pay attention, &amp; think.)</p>
