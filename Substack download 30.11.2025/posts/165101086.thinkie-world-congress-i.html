<p>One day until TWC I (I think we’re going with the Super Bowl-style Roman numeraling). It’s sold out, but we hope to have a larger-capacity TWC II soon so if you missed out, please don’t despair.</p><p>I want to thank the team, without whom this definitely wouldn’t have happened.</p><ul><li><p><span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Arty Starr&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:57987789,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00d734ca-e886-40f3-8130-9e334b263d43_144x144.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;13f6f832-1336-49f5-9d62-ac371571c340&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> —the ringleader.

I’m so glad I could bring this experience to our community first, &amp; again I couldn’t have done it without the team. I don’t know if any of them are looking for work but you should shower them with bags of gold &amp; see what happens.</p><p>P.S. I’ll get back to writing up the last few weekly Thinkies when TWC has settled down. The end is in sight! What happens then? No idea.</p>
