<blockquote><p>“Many a true word hath been spoken in jest.”<br>―William Shakespeare, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2342136">King Lear</a></p></blockquote><p>The next Thinkie in the language section is Laughter. Come to think of it, it’s not so much a language game as a social game. Whatever, the classification scheme is still evolving.</p><p>Pattern: A statement in conversation is followed by nervous laughter.</p><p>Transformation: Take the statement seriously.</p><p>Example: “If we could just throw away all the source code &amp; start over we could certainly succeed.” Maybe so. Time to evaluate.</p><p>Now this is maybe part of the magic of Thinkies for me. Defer judgement a minute. What would it look like to throw away all the source code? What would be required? Who would win? Who would lose? Okay, <em>now</em> what do you think of the idea?</p><p>Thinkies are a way of generating <em>lots</em> of ideas, not generating <em>good</em> ideas. And Thinkies generate lots of ideas that other folks seem to miss. And every once in a while one of them is good.</p><p>Again, try it. Note when you try it. Share with a friend. Maybe it’ll become a habit.</p><blockquote><p>Please keep these written notes within the group of paid Tidy First? subscribers. If you want to write up your experience with a Thinkie, please do. I’m able to write more freely &amp; expose these ideas sooner if I know I’ll get another shot at editing them before they go public.</p></blockquote><p></p>
