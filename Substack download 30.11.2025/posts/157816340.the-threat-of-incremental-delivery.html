<p>“That looks great! We’ll ship it!”<br>“No, it’s just a mockup.”<br>“It’s almost done. How hard can it be?”</p><p> “Kent”</p><p>“We got this demo done in a week, but to finish it will take…”<br>”If you can get this much done in a week, why isn’t it finished?”</p><p>“Kent!”</p><p>“We can do anything, but we can’t do everything at once. What part would you like first?”<br>”If it’s not all finished according to this spec it’s worthless.”</p><p>“Kent!!! Wake up. You’re having a nightmare.”</p><p>One of the tools The Forest &amp; The Desert gives me is the ability to communicate across the divide between the two. XP teams are able to slice business functionality finely in any number of ways. I always thought that was a good thing. Not in The Desert it’s not.</p><h2>Incremental Delivery</h2><p>Henrik Knieberg notably <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp">described incremental delivery thusly</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png" width="300" height="192" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:192,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Agile incremental delivery visualized – how to explain Agile ...&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Agile incremental delivery visualized – how to explain Agile ..." title="Agile incremental delivery visualized – how to explain Agile ..." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7qH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bef9300-3de0-415f-918c-0c28e1e6183c_300x192.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I can’t improve on that picture, so I won’t try. You need fast transportation. Rather than focus on the car you “know” you want, you start quickly with something that provides <em>some</em> transportation, then iterate from there, fulfilling more of your desires with each generation.</p><p>I saw the advantages of incremental delivery from my first Smalltalk programming sessions. I can explain those advantages better now:</p><ul><li><p>Better cash flow (revenue sooner, expenses later).</p></li><li><p>Better optionality.</p></li><li><p>More learning.</p></li><li><p>Better relationships with customers.</p></li></ul><p>Seems like a pretty obvious win. In The Forest, yes. Not in The Desert. In The Desert incremental delivery is dangerous.</p><h2>Increments in The Desert</h2><p>We’ll take the 3 nightmare scenarios that opened this essay as examples of how The Desert comes to hate incremental delivery. And how that distaste makes sense in a Desert frame of reference.</p><h3>All Or Nothing</h3><p>In the last, those asking for changes insist that all changes must be in place before any value can be extracted. Put the requester’s hat on for a moment. In their experience, they are unlikely to receive many of the changes they request. Now that they have Engineering’s attention, they’re going to ask for everything they need because they don’t know when that attention will wander and, if it does wander, when they’ll ever get that attention back.</p><p>“What can we give you after the first week?” is rightly seen as a threat, a chance for someone to say, “Okay, that’s enough.” Holding the line for <em>all</em> the changes is the best strategy for getting <em>any</em> needs met.</p><h3>More, More, More</h3><p>In the middle scenario, the danger shifts to Engineering. There’s never enough in The Desert. Accomplishing something is seen as evidence that more could have been accomplished but the team didn’t try hard enough or didn’t care enough or just flat out made mistakes.</p><p>The longer you can hold off on delivering, the more strenuous effort you demonstrate. Throw in a couple of missed deadlines, a few yellow status reports, &amp; you have the makings of an “exceeds expectations” rating (the key to exceeding expectations is to first lower the expectations).</p><h3>Demo = Done</h3><p>In the opening scenario, the shiny demo is seen to be the whole project. God help you if you show Sales the demo &amp; they show a customer &amp; the customer signs on the dotted line. Now you are the one on the hook for disappointing the customer.</p><p>This is a particularly nasty variety of (from The Forest’s perspective) dysfunction. You need feedback. If the only way you can get feedback is guaranteed to bring blame &amp; negative consequences, that creates an ugly dilemma. Do you go with your best assumptions in hopes that what you (eventually) show to customers will meet their needs? Do you demo &amp; then scramble to provide some kind of, any kind of, underlying implementation?</p><h2>Parallel Universes</h2><p>The Forest &amp; The Desert aren’t just 2 ways to develop software. They stem from mutually incomprehensible fundamental principles. With effort, from The Forest we can understand &amp; appreciate what The Desert goes through to get anything done at all, even as we work to make our Forest more sustainable.</p><p></p>
