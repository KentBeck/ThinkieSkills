<p>Let me know if I’m writing too frequently or about right. In tonight’s CH Keith Adams and I will discuss former Waze CEO Noam Bardin’s <a href="https://paygo.media/p/25171">critique</a> of his time as a Google subsidiary from an incentives perspective. We’ll also talk about how Geek Incentives creates a space of possible incentive systems for us to explore. We’ll also answer questions brought by you all.</p><p>https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/MzYbo6Zw</p>
