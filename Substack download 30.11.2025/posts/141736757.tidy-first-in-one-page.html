<p>When geeks run off to start tidying, resistance from various angles quickly appears. Product managers, engineering managers, even colleagues push back. Stop wasting time on this design crap &amp; get back to churning out features.</p><p>As with Extreme Programming, any change that’s going to stick needs a partnership between implementors &amp; executives. With that pair singing from the same page, customers &amp; the management between eventually harmonize. Without an executive/geek partnership, attempts to change splutter out or go underground.</p><p>Starting next week &amp; weekly for 8 weeks, paying subscribers will be seeing chapters of <em>The Surprise Factory</em>, a 20-page executive briefing on <em>Tidy First?</em> The titular factory is software development that frequently delivers happy surprises to customers, product, management, &amp; investors. Software design is the missing skill/activity standing in the way of creating a Surprise Factory, &amp; executive support is the key organizational ingredient.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Here is the one-page briefing-on-a-briefing (on a book that’s the first of a series—I have a lot of work to do!)</p><blockquote><p>Briefing on the Briefing</p><p>This book will help you, an executive in a software-based business, create a Surprise Factory, a team frequently delivering pleasant surprises. Sound unlikely? I hope you’ll stick with me. The missing ingredient is software design (aka "paying down technical debt" aka "refactoring"), but in the right proportions at the right times.</p><p>If you only have a minute to read, here are the classic software design blunders:</p><ul><li><p>Thou shalt not rewrite the whole system.</p></li><li><p>Thou shalt not pause delivery of features for an extended period to fix the design.</p></li><li><p>Thou shalt not delay the first feature to "get the design right".</p></li><li><p>Thou shalt not thoughtlessly demand the next feature immediately upon completion of the last.</p></li></ul><p>Why not, &amp; what to do instead, are the topic of this briefing.</p><p>Mixing software design into development isn’t one of those monochrome problems. Your team needs your judgement, perspective, &amp; vision to balance today’s needs &amp; tomorrow’s opportunities.</p><p>For more detail, see <em>Tidy First?: A Daily Exercise in Empirical Software Design </em>or contact the author at kentlbeck@gmail.com.</p></blockquote>
