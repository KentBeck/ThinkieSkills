<blockquote><p>As so often happens, when I’m having trouble writing it’s because I’m writing too much, covering too much scope at once. I turned the previous chapter on economics into 4 chapters and out it came. I’ll post the next one tomorrow.</p></blockquote><p>Somehow I got to my mid-30s understanding nothing about the nature of money. I could buy &amp; sell stuff, I could "make" money, but I didn't understand the physics of moving money at all.</p><p>Computing to the rescue. A series of finance-related projects forced me to program basic money-related concepts. Since programming is how I understand the world, I started to understand money. Over time the lessons soaked into my intuition &amp; changed how I saw development.</p><p>Mark Buchan in "Frozen Desire" makes the case that we often want stuff but not right away, &amp; that money represents this "frozen desire". If you have created enough value to eat for a month, but you don't want to store a month's food, it's extremely convenient to be able to store the value you've created and turn it into fresh lettuce a week at a time.</p><p>Money, though, is curious stuff. It has its own nature. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>The combination of money's nature &amp; money's centrality to the work we do leads to tension. What makes sense for us to do as programmers may go contrary to the nature of money. When geeky imperatives clash with money imperatives, money wins. Eventually.</p><p>Once my lessons in the nature of money had soaked into my intuition, I found my attitude toward programming shifting. Strategies that made perfect sense to me now seemed bizarre where they contradicted the nature of money. Strategies that had seemed fringe or sketchy or naive became just sensible money management. The more I rowed with the Stream of Commerce, the faster my boat went.</p><p>The nature I learned consisted of 2 surprising properties:</p><ul><li><p>A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, so earn sooner &amp; spend later.</p></li><li><p>In a chaotic situation, options are better than things, so create options in the face of uncertainty.</p></li></ul><p>These two strategies conflict at times. Earning money now can reduce future options. But maybe if you don't earn money now you won't be around to exercise those future options.</p><p>Software design is one way to reconcile the imperatives of "earn sooner/spend later" &amp; "create options not things". We'll get to how software design interacts with money after we've looked at these two effects--time value of money &amp; optionality--in more detail.</p>
