<p>One thought &amp; I can go enjoy my birthday weekend. I was re-watching “Halleluah: Leonard Cohen, A Song, A Life” the other day. A quote hit me &amp; I started crying.</p><p>Leonard had just had all his money stolen by his business manager. At the age of 70 he was flat broke and, as he put it, not in old age but definitely on the foothills of old age. And so he started writing songs again &amp; performing again.</p><p>Here’s the quote: “That urgent invitation to complete one’s work is very much in my life. And it’s more urgent than the economic necessity. That the two coincide is just a coincidence.” (This is at 1:36:10 if you go to Netflix.)</p><p>I feel that. I see something in programming, in the practice of it, in the consequences of it, in the joy &amp; frustration, in the lure of solitude &amp; the necessity of human connection, that I don’t see reflected in the people I talk to about programming. I think they are missing something. I want to crack open the shell. To give them a chance to glimpse what I see. Whether they choose to look is up to them.</p><p>Along the way I expect to learn. I expect to earn. But I feel an urgency to the calling most of all. Time is all I have &amp; it’s ticking away. One second every second. I feel the urgent invitation to complete my work.</p><p>Peace.</p>
