<p>What could <em>you</em> do by combining rapidly-improving AI with the world’s largest, best curated medical data set?</p><p>This week I attended the Showcase for Mayo Clinic Platform Accelerate where startups showed off their progress. I wore my investor hat a little, my technology advisor hat, my curious geek hat, &amp; my proud dad hat as my middle daughter helps run the accelerator.</p><p>Companies generally join Accelerate after they have had some success building models with more limited data. At Mayo they refine their models in preparation for attracting investment &amp; entering clinical trials.</p><p>Here’s what I learned &amp; which companies were my favorites.</p><h2>The Program</h2><p>The Mayo Clinic Accelerator gives teams 20 weeks of access to Mayo’s incredible trove of medical data—charts, electronic health records, imaging. The data is carefully de-identified (more on this later) &amp; access to the data is strictly controlled to prevent exfiltration. </p><h2>De-Identified</h2><p>Regulation &amp; ethics forbids revealing patient identities to parties not needing to know. Maintaining privacy is far trickier than I thought going in. My first guess was that holders of identified health data need only delete, e.g., names &amp; addresses before passing it along. How naive!</p><p>If you’re the only person in Chicago with a condition, then saying, “Someone in Chicago with XXX,” is the same as pointing directly at you (Mayo studies lots of conditions like this). Geographic fuzzing ensures that sufferers from a rare disease can’t be identified like this. A condition partly caused by geography (think pollution downstream of a factory) can’t be as readily studied if you only know folks’ location within 100 km, but that’s the tradeoff.</p><p>A more extreme (and cooler) form of de-identifying data is de-skulling. Say you have a scan of a brain. If you retain the bone structure in the images then facial recognition can identify the patient. Images used for training, then, are prepared by removing all evidence of bone. This process, cool in itself, is charmingly called “brain extraction”. Why can’t I work on brain extraction?</p><h2>Japan</h2><p>Why would Japan be highly represented (5 out of 15 startups) in a program like Accelerate? Takeo Nakajima, Director-General at the Innovation Department of JETRO, the Japan External Trade Organization, addressed the Showcase. Japan’s aging population is hitting their health care system 20 years ahead of the wave approaching in the rest of the developed world. Improvement sooner matters more to Japanese society, hence the governmental support for innovation in health care.</p><h2>The Companies</h2><p>I spoke with a half dozen teams &amp; listened to the pitches of the rest. I don’t have any experience with health care investing, so I’m just going on gut &amp; listening to stories. This is not investment advice! But here are my favorites:</p><p></p><h2>Culture</h2><p>The Mayo Institute as a whole intends to advance the state of health care &amp; deliver the best care to the patients most in need. Mayo Institute Platform intends to accelerate the adoption of digital health care in the face of challenges like ransomware attacks (a huge problem), validation, &amp; integration with existing systems. Mayo Institute Platform Accelerate supports innovative digital health startups with access to Mayo’s vast data archives.</p><p>None of the startups in this cohort are trying to provide ground-breaking health care. They are making good health care available to a wider audience—lower price where that is the bottleneck, less skill needed where that is the bottleneck. What happens when, “Advance the state of health care/deliver it to the patients most in need,” runs into, “Make decent health care available to a wider audience”? This will be an interesting culture clash to watch. </p>
