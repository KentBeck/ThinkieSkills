<p>September 1, 2028</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>What I’m most proud of during my time at Roblox is how I lived a great life the whole time while having significant impact. My entire career I’ve never managed to maintain those two goals for any length of time. Here I did it for 4 years. No migraines. No blood pressure problems. I stayed fit, creative, I travelled. I built &amp; maintained my relationships, in and out of tech.</p><p>At Roblox I tackled new challenges with rests between. That was the key, a rhythm of finding an opportunity, addressing it, passing the torch, then sitting (actively) until I spotted the next opportunity. Engineers have been promoted, teams have been righted, engineers now come to Roblox because of the outstanding opportunities it offers talented, potential-filled young-uns.</p><p>I didn’t have this impact by blindly copying past successes. I started teams. I managed teams (briefly). I initiated product features. I contributed to boardroom decisions. And yes I coached &amp; wrote &amp; spoke &amp; counseled &amp; mentored.</p><p>To bring this reminiscence full circle, living a good life &amp; contributing to Roblox paid me back. I did my part to boost the stock price &amp; now I have financial security &amp; options I didn’t have 4 years ago. My time at Roblox built me a house, something I’ve dreamed of since I was a kid but had kind of given up hope for.</p><p>I only planned to be here 3 years but I’ve been having so much fun I made it 4. Now, though, it’s time to move on. Time for art, for travel, for stories, for poker, all while I still can.</p><p>I’m not really retiring—you won’t get rid of me that easily. I won’t say goodbye. I’ll say auf wiedersehen. See you further down the road.</p><p>Kent Beck</p>
