<p>And with that you are prepared to answer the question Tidy First? Over &amp; over. Each time slightly different but each time affected by the same forces:</p><ul><li><p>Cost. Will tidying make costs smaller, later, or less likely?</p></li><li><p>Revenue. Will tidying make revenue larger, sooner, or more likely?</p></li><li><p>Coupling. Will tidying make it so I need to change fewer elements?</p></li><li><p>Cohesion. Will tidying make it so the elements I need to change are in a smaller, more concentrated scope?</p></li></ul><p>Most important, though, is you. Will tidying bring peace, satisfaction, &amp; joy to your programming? Because if you are your best self, you are a better programmer. You can't be your best self if you're always rushing, if you're always changing code that's painful to change.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Don't get carried away with tidying. Once you realize you can make your own life &amp; work better by tidying, sometimes &amp; somewhat, you can get giddy. Unlike the risk &amp; uncertainty of features, where you can do what you think is right &amp; folks can still be dissatisfied, you are the audience for your tidying &amp; you're very likely to be satisfied.</p><p>Coupling conducts one tidying to the next to the next. Tidyings are the Pringles of software design. When you're tidying first, resist the urge to eat the next one. Tidying to enable the next behavior change. Save the tidying binge for later, when you can go nuts without delaying the change someone else is waiting for.</p><p>And be aware that as you practice tidying for yourself, you are preparing to design on behalf of others like you. That's where this is going--making software design an ordinary, balanced part of development.</p><p>We seldom program alone. Just as there is coupling between elements in a design, we are coupled to each other. A change I make can ripple to you &amp; a change you make can ripple to me.</p><p>The next book in the series examines the relationship between changers, those who can directly change the system. We must get these relationships healthy before we are prepared for the ultimate relationship challenge, between changers &amp; those who can do little but wait for our changes to land. Software design can nourish these relationships or damage them. But that's for another day, another book.</p><p>Tidy first? Likely yes. Just enough. You're worth it.</p>
