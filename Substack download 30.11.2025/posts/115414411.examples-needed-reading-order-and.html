<p>While reviewing the first draft I realized that these two tidyings could use an example or two. Send ‘em, please!</p><p>To review for the many of you who weren’t here when the chapters were published:</p><ul><li><p>Reading Order says that you take an element with randomly sorted sub-elements (e.g. a file with functions or a class with methods) &amp; place the sub-elements in the order you wish they had been when you read the code.</p></li><li><p>Cohesion Order changes the ordering criteria to make sure that coupled sub-elements (those that have to change at the same time) are adjacent.</p></li></ul><p>Here’s what I need: before and after code where you applied one of these tidyings. I will likely abstract what you send me to make it easier to read/grasp.</p><p>Old:</p><blockquote><p>write()</p><p>read()</p><p>process()</p></blockquote><p>New:</p><blockquote><p>read()</p><p>process()</p><p>write()</p></blockquote><p>Something like that. Alternatively, the element could be a function &amp; you re-ordered the statements for readability or cohesion.</p><p>Looking forward to your examples!</p>
