<blockquote><p>It’s been a while since the last chapter. The end is in sight, though. I have a table of contents I like and I can see how to get all these chapters written. Expect more soon.</p></blockquote><p>In <em>Tidy First?</em> we explored how software creates value in two fundamental ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Features</strong> — what it does today</p></li><li><p><strong>Options</strong> — what it could do tomorrow</p></li></ul><p>Features deliver immediate value through behavior—calculating payroll, processing orders, sending notifications, reducing usage. Options preserve our ability to adapt, to respond to the unexpected, to seize opportunities we can't yet imagine.</p><p>At the time, I focused on the economic tension between these two sources of value. Time value of money pulls us toward <strong>features now, options later</strong>. But options become more valuable in uncertain environments, and software development is nothing if not uncertain. The question, <em>"Tidy first?"</em> sits right at this intersection of competing forces.</p><p>What I didn’t immediately understand was how to visualize this relationship. How do you think about the balance between features and options over time? How do you see ahead to the patterns that lead to success—or disaster?</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Visualization Challenge</h2><p>For years I tried to draw this relationship using time as one of the axes. Features over time. Options over time. The cumulative investment in each. But these graphs never felt right. They obscured more than they revealed.</p><p><em>Imagine two colors: one for features, one for options.</em></p><p>Then I remembered Edward Tufte’s trick of abandoning time as an axis. Time isn't the fundamental relationship here—the fundamental relationship is <strong>between features and options</strong>.</p><p>So I tried something different. Features on the horizontal axis. Options on the vertical.</p><p><em>Visual 1: an empty graph with labeled axes—Features (X) and Options (Y).</em></p><p>Each point represents a moment in the life of a software system, showing how many features it has and how much capacity it retains for future change. At first we have lots of options and no features.</p><p><em>Visual 2: a single point high on the Y-axis, near zero on X.</em></p><p>Implementing a feature inevitably reduces options, if for no other reason than we have to keep that feature working.</p><p><em>Visual 3: a second point, further right and slightly lower.</em></p><p>Pleased with the improvement in features and unaware of the value of options, we’re tempted to just implement the next feature... and the next.</p><p><em>Visual 4: a series of dots arcing down toward the X-axis.</em></p><p>Eventually we approach <strong>no remaining options</strong>. Either we milk the system for all its remaining dollars, or we start a big rewrite. (The rewrite is complicated by pent-up demand for features.)</p><p><em>Visual 5: a big lurch up and a little to the right.</em></p><p>Such projects are among the most challenging software efforts to pull off successfully because of the many competing constraints.</p><p><em>At the risk of dating this post, AI-based coding genies are currently prone to exactly this error.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Two Paths, Two Destinies</h2><p>I call the above trajectory an error because we have an alternative. Well, at least we do once we’ve read this book series.</p><p>What does empirical software design offer?</p><p>The empirical approach follows a different path. We alternate. We can’t avoid burning options while implementing features. We shouldn’t waste options—my books <em>Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns</em> and <em>Implementation Patterns</em> cover this in detail. But it’s going to happen.</p><p><em>Visual 6: same two dots as before, now in a new color or pattern.</em></p><p>After we add a feature, we invest in options.</p><p><em>Visual 7: a third point directly above the second.</em></p><p>Notice the new state is <strong>directly above</strong> the previous one? When we design, when we change structure, when we add options, that’s all we do. Remember <em>structure &amp; behavior diffs</em> from <em>Tidy First</em>? This is what a sequence of those diffs looks like, visualized this way.</p><p>Another feature. More options. Another feature. More options.</p><p><em>Visual 8: a sawtooth line climbing diagonally up and to the right.</em></p><p>This alternating rhythm is what we’ve been building toward throughout both books. Tidy first, then implement the feature. Or implement the feature, then tidy after. Sometimes batch the tidying for later. But always, always maintain the balance.</p><p>The empirical approach requires awareness.</p><p>When you’re in a feature-adding phase, it’s tempting to just keep going:</p><blockquote><p><em>“We’re on a roll! Let’s just get this next feature in.”</em></p></blockquote><p>But each additional feature without corresponding options investment pushes you toward that flat line at the bottom.</p><p>When you’re in an options-investing phase, there’s pressure from the other direction:</p><blockquote><p><em>“When are we going to ship something users can see?”</em></p></blockquote><p>Options feel abstract. Features feel real. But they are both forms of value. I’m trying to help you learn <strong>rhythm &amp; balance</strong> between the two.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Reading the Graph</h2><p>Once you can see your project’s position on this graph, certain decisions become clearer.</p><ul><li><p>If you’re far toward the <strong>bottom</strong>, with few options remaining, any significant new feature is probably a mistake. Better to invest in options first—give yourself room to maneuver.</p></li><li><p>If you’re high on the <strong>options axis</strong> but light on features, you might be over-engineering. Are all those options you invested in actually options? Theory without practice is sterile. Features teach you what options you actually need.</p></li></ul><p>The sweet spot isn’t a fixed point—it’s a <strong>dynamic balance</strong>. Sometimes you move more horizontally, sometimes more vertically. But you never stay in one direction too long.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Missing Dimension</h2><p>Features and options capture much of the economic reality of software development. Balancing investment in both is crucial to the long-term success of a software product.</p><p>But as I’ve worked with this model, I’ve realized there’s a <strong>third dimension</strong> we haven’t adequately addressed: <em>survival</em>.</p><p>We’ll explore survival in the next chapter.</p>
