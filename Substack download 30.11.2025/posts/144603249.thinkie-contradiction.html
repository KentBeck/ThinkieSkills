<p>Here’s another consulting Thinkie. When consulting you take in a river of information, make sense of it quickly, &amp; pick one or two salient points to get across. Folks don’t want to pay your rates for deep analysis, at least not at first. So, how can you quickly find something useful to say.</p><p>Pattern: you are faced with a big, complicated situation in need of improvement.</p><p>Transformation: find 2 statements by the client that contradict &amp; (gently) point out the contradiction.</p><p>Say you’re talking about the Agile Manifesto. “Oh, we are totally aligned with the Agile Values. But also everything needs to be tracked in Jira.” Um, uh, I don’t understand how those 2 sentences go together. My naive interpretation of both seems to put them in direct contradiction.</p><p>As with the Thinkie Incongruence, the trick is the delivery of the message. These 2 Thinkies together are pretty much guaranteed to deliver you a salient message or two. Delivering the message while building a relationship instead of damaging it is another challenge. But that’s out of scope for Thinkies. They make the ideas—you decide.</p>
