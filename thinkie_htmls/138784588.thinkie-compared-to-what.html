<blockquote><p>Comparison is the thief of joy. But also a useful tool.</p></blockquote><p>This is another highly profitable Thinkie. It doesn’t take much effort once you identify the pattern. The transformation also doesn’t take much effort, at least not until you start digging in.</p><p>Pattern: You hear a judgement without context.</p><p>Transformation: “Compared to what?”</p><p>“Development is so slow.” “Compared to what?”—This sparks interesting conversations. Compared to a year ago? Okay, what changed in that time? Compared to another team? Compared to someone’s demands?</p><p>“We can’t stop reviewing code. The design will degrade.” “Will it degrade faster than it is degrading now?”—People sometimes seek excuses to remain in the status quo. CTW? can pop them out of that thinking. “Worse than what’s already happening?” can get people out of perfection-induced inertia.</p><p>“Autonomous vehicles will kill people.” “Compared to what?”—Autonomous vehicles are scary. I get it. I’m a software engineer &amp; I’m terrified. However, there are people alive today who would have been dead had a human driver been at the wheel. Yes, the reverse is true, people dead today because of an autonomous vehicle. If autonomous vehicles kill a third as many people (say), then our fear is not just holding us back, our fear is killing people.</p>
