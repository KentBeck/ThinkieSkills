<p>Pattern: Two or more parties are struggling to cooperate.</p><p>Transformation: Model the situation as a Prisoners’ Dilemma. If it fits, apply Thinkie Put Skin In The Game or iteration to break the impasse.</p><p>To recap, Prisoners’ Dilemma is a game where 2 parties are arrested. If neither confesses, they both go free. If one confesses &amp; the other doesn’t, the squealer goes free &amp; the other prisoner goes to prison. If they both confess, they both go to prison but for less time.</p><p>See if the parties in the impasse are feeling like they are in a Prisoners’ Dilemma. “If I work on this urgent task Saturday &amp; you don’t work Saturday I’ll feel like a sucker.”</p><p>What makes the Prisoners’ Dilemma intractable is the lack of information. The way out? Information.</p><ul><li><p>Thinkie Put Skin In The Game signals that one party is opening themself up to negative consequences.</p></li><li><p>Iteration. If the same 2 prisoners play Prisoners’ Dilemma 100 times, they have incentive to build a habit of cooperation (not confessing). Slice your cooperation into many iterations &amp; see how that works.</p></li><li><p>Call out the dilemma. Sometimes it helps to just say, “You’re afraid of being taken advantage of. Me too. &lt;nervous laughter&gt; What are we going to do about this?”</p></li></ul>
