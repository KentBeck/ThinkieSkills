<p>Pattern: Someone is stuck trying to make progress. They fantasize about what would be required to get unstuck.</p><p>Transformation: You respond with, “But what if you could &lt;do whatever they just said&gt;…”</p><p>This Thinkie is similar, now that I write out, to Laughter. They are based on the same premise—people often know exactly what to do but they prevent themselves from doing it (for a host of annoying psychological reasons).</p><p>“We’d love to deploy more often. That would solve a host of integration problems.”</p><p>“What if you could?”</p><p>“Yeah, that’d be great. But we can’t.”</p><p>“What if you could?”</p><p>Executing this Thinkie requires a tricky bit of “one foot on the dock &amp; one foot in the boat”. You have to be in the situation enough for people to trust you with their frustration &amp; their fantasized solution. At the same time you have to be detached enough not to get co-stuck with the rest of the team.</p><p>Expect a lot of resistance. People (by which I mean “me”) get real attached to their stuckness. I’m the person who just can’t write software without bugs. I’m the person who just can’t get ahead financially. I’m the person who can’t write a book.</p><p>Your job is to hold space for someone just long enough for them to reframe themselves as them, but without the stuckness. You’re not trying to “fix” them (again, I’m speaking to me). You’re opening a door. Whether they walk through it is up to them. The Thinkie If You Could generated the door.</p><p>Something I like about If You Could is that even if it doesn’t “work” (there I go with the fixing metaphor again), the spin-offs are often useful. We want to deploy more often but we can’t because of bugs, breaking changes, &amp; lack of monitoring. So we work on monitoring &amp; life gets better even before we’ve seen progress on our overall goal.</p>
