<p>Pattern: Two or more parties are stuck in a dysfunctional relationship but everyone refuses to change.</p><p>Transformation: Take a step back &amp; show the whole dynamic to all parties.</p><p>These kinds of change-encouraging Thinkies are fraught. People don’t make rational choices. I still tend to assume they do, leaving me baffled most of the time. However, it’s just not in me to do nothing.</p><p>The dynamic here is that everyone thinks they will lose if they change so they stay still no matter how unpleasant the status quo.</p><p>One of my most vivid professional encounters with a Nash Equilibrium was when interviewing a team that was perpetually late delivering. I asked the team how they estimated. They walked me through their process, including adding padding to individual tasks &amp; then to the schedule as a whole.</p><p>“Why all this padding? You don’t think it will actually take this long.”</p><p>“Yes, but management always cuts our estimates in half.”</p><p>(Ironic because those “padded” estimates were accurate historically.)</p><p>Then I went to talk to the executives.</p><p>“We have to cut their estimates in half because we know they are sandbagging.”</p><p>“But they are always late.”</p><p>I was confused. I got everyone in a room &amp; pled with them to just be straight with each other. They ignored me. But I tried.</p><p>Both parties felt like if they were honest about their estimates they would definitely lose. Neither could change. And so the wasteful (to me—to them it was safe) dance continued.</p>
