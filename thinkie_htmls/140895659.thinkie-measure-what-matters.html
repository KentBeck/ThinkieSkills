<p>Trigger: you are measuring the steps of a multi-stage process but you aren’t seeing the large-scale improvement you want.</p><p>Transformation: measure the value you actually want to change, even if that measure is vague or not actionable or complicated.</p><p>If you care about profit, measure profit. If you care about customer satisfaction, measure customer satisfaction. If you care about employee retention, measure employee retention.</p><p>Measurement appeals to our need for certainty &amp; predictability. However, most measures the provide a sense of certainty &amp; predictability are illusions. We all operate in complex contexts. Cause &amp; effect have no obvious connection &amp; are anyway subject to variance, reinforcing &amp; inhibiting feedback loops, &amp; measurement error.</p><p>When I’ve succumbed to the siren call of micro-optimization, when I’ve then become frustrated at the lack of overall progress, when I’ve started thrashing, then it helps me to take a step back &amp; look at the bigger picture. What is it I actually want?</p><p>I used this Thinkie recently as I dealt with my frustration about this newsletter. I had been measuring total historical revenue—it’s great compared to just publishing a book but I was running out of energy &amp; feeling financial pressure. Then I was measuring daily revenue, which had tons of noise &amp; anyway didn’t relieve the financial pressure.</p><p>What matters? Am I reliably making enough so I don’t have rely on bursty (&amp; recently diminished) consulting/speaking income? My current monthly run rate is $X. I need it to triple. MRR changes more slowly than daily revenue, it’s true. It doesn’t show the effects of today’s brilliant (or dud) post. But it’s what matters.</p>
