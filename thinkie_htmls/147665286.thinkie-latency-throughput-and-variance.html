<p>Pattern: Someone says, “I need you to go faster!” You’re going as fast as you can. What do you do?</p><p>Transformation: The situation is under-constrained. “Go faster!” can mean any of several things. Find out which, then bias towards reducing variance first.</p><p>I ordered my first Waymo autonomous ride last night. When I arrived I realized that I was much more relaxed than I usually am after a lyftuber. What was going on?</p><p>When I have a human driver, I feel the need to monitor what they do. First, just to see if they are actually going to pick me up or if they are driving off into the sunset. Then every turn is a chance for them to make a mistake. And they make enough mistakes that it’s valuable to catch one early.</p><p>I checked with myself—am I making this up? (I’m prone to anxiety—more about that later.) Nope. Human drivers really do make enough mistakes, and consequential enough mistakes, that I’m better off staying vigilant.</p><p>In the autonomous vehicle, this all goes away. Car’s gonna do what car’s gonna do. I can safely blank out until we arrive.</p><p>The autonomous car isn’t getting me there faster. Same roads, same traffic, same traffic lights. It’s the reduction in variance that creates value.</p><p>Back to the Thinkie—sometimes “go faster!” (always with the implied exclamation point) means, “I need more items done over the next unit of time.” Sometimes it means, “I need the next item sooner than I got the last item.” These two goals, throughput &amp; latency, can be mutually antagonistic. Yes, we can (or think we can) get more done in the next month by batching many items up &amp; delivering them all at the end of the month, but then you won’t see an item for a month. Or yes, we can get you the next item today, but only by cutting corners &amp; reducing the number of items you’ll see this month.</p><p>Identifying which is the more important goal is a useful first step. You’ll develop differently depending on whether latency or throughput improvement creates more value (and either goal is legitimate—see also 3X: Explore/Expand/Extract). If someone demands improvement in both latency &amp; throughput, you can eventually do that, but it’s hard-to-impossible to make progress on both simultaneously. “Which would you like to see first?”</p><p>Which brings us back to variance. There’s another Thinkie “Go Upstream” at work. Unproductive variance is often the unremarked precursor to friction in latency or throughput. Have trouble pushing changes to production without unexpected errors? The resulting hesitancy, extra review steps, extra staging environments, loss of confidence, these will all delay the next item being accomplished &amp; reduce the number of items you can get done this week.</p><p>Another possible outcome is that the dissatisfaction with latency or throughput was actually dissatisfaction with variance. If you routinely get done each week what you said you’d get done, sometimes the customer is happy with that. What they were unhappy with was how much less you sometimes accomplished.</p><p>Tackle variance first. Measure what happens to latency &amp; throughput. Maybe they’ll be fine now. If not, pick one &amp; work on it, but work on it variance-first.</p>
