<p>Trigger: You have a multi-stage process A→B→C→D</p><p>Transformation: What happens if you start with B, C, or D?</p><p>Test-driven development is my favorite example of this Thinkie. Everybody codes &amp; then tests? What if we test &amp; then code?</p><p>The Half Wavelength Shift will test your skill at deferring judgement. A comes before B, C, &amp; D for good reasons. Setting those reasons aside for a moment is likely to be hard.</p><p>The seeds of the Half Wavelength Shift were planted when my dad let me play with his oscilloscope &amp; wave generator. I got used to seeing sine waves &amp; then watching them shift horizontally. Just because you have a waveform, that doesn’t mean that it’s immutable.</p>
