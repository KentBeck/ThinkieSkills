No idea what book it was. I didn’t really understand any of it. However, I plowed through it.</p><p>The one theme it repeated was the difference between “maximization” &amp; “optimization”.  At the time I didn’t even know what “optimization” meant. I just knew I was fascinated.</p><p>Come to discover that understanding the difference between maximization &amp; optimization is one of the cornerstones of my career. When others are maximizing &amp; I come in with a tradeoff it can be a ray of light. Or I get fired. Again.</p><p>One example out of many in my career—at Facebook we noticed that when we switched from a chronological NewsFeed to a curated feed, engagement went up. The difference was significant enough that we began involuntarily switching folks to curated even if they had explicitly chosen a chronological feed. The argument was, “More engagement, more better.” The folks whose OKRs depended on engagement metrics need <em>some</em> way to improve engagement.</p><p>My position was that the decision was a tradeoff. We got more engagement but at the cost of user trust. Every time a user noticed that they’d been switched, they trusted Facebook less. I have ethical objections to pretending to give folks a choice, but what I truly hated was pretending like more engagement was good regardless of the longer-term, larger-scale consequences.</p><p>Next up: Thinkie Response Curves, because tradeoffs are often plastic, moldable.</p><p></p><p></p>
