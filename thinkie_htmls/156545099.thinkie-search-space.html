<p>Pattern: You need to act in a context where you can’t predict what the result of actions will be.</p><p>Transformation: Treat the choice of action as moves around a search space.

Small differences in where you search make a big difference in whether you find a clue. Your search should be thorough &amp; methodical.</p><p>Product decisions in a rich &amp; rapidly emerging sector are spiky but there are probably many sources of value. Mostly take big jumps with the occasional small step.</p><p>Exploring a search space is a tricky mix of intuition &amp; chaos. Your intuition will probably be speaking loudly, because it wants predictable success. If it’s truly a search, though, you can’t predict success, you can only discover it.</p>
