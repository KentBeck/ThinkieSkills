<p>We’ve completed the language Thinkies &amp; the project management Thinkies. A dozen down &amp; 2-3 more dozen to go.</p><p>Now we’re getting into some systems thinking Thinkies. These address the natural human tendency to get bogged down in details &amp; miss more-effective action at a different scale.</p><p>Pattern: insufficient value is flowing through a series of steps.</p><p>Transformation: Compare the capacity of each of the steps. Whichever step is the constraint, add capacity to it, even at the expense of other steps. Once the pipes match, you can think about how to improve overall capacity.</p><p><em>Divide et impera</em> is deeply impressed in our brains. If only we could break the problem into parts then solve the parts separately, then we’d go faster! Not so fast, buster.</p><ul><li><p>We still have to integrate the separate solutions. Integration problems can easily consume all the theoretical gains &amp; more.</p></li><li><p>Since we’re dealing with people, each of those divided parts is an organization of its own with its own incentives imperfectly aligned with the incentives of any other sub-organization or the organization as a whole.</p></li></ul><p>The classic example I encountered frequently as a young engineer was the split between engineering &amp; testing. Engineering would typically go “too fast” for testing to keep up (it was easy to justify more engineers, hard to justify more testers). This left engineering starved for feedback but still pressured to produce faster, resulting in wasted effort, frustration, deteriorating relationships, all in doom cycles.</p><p>The short-term fix was just to shortcut testing &amp; ship defects. This came with its own set of larger-scale problems &amp; doom cycles.</p><p>The Extreme Programming solution was for engineers to “go slower” by writing demonstrably production-ready code. This better matched the capacity of engineering &amp; testing &amp; resulted in a larger, smoother flow of value.</p><p>Match the Pipes reminds me of other Thinkies I need to write:</p><ul><li><p>Observe Later</p></li><li><p>Observe What You Care About Imperfectly</p></li></ul>
