<p>Pattern: You’re trying to predict the consequences of a trend.</p><p>Transformation: Extrapolate further than other people, further than seems reasonable.</p><p>I learned this Thinkie watching Bill Joy (Sun founder) talk about processor performance when I was a wee engineer at Tektronix. 32-bit processors had just appeared, with awesome performance. Intel &amp; Motorola were promising great improvements in the next few years. Bill stood up &amp; talked about how Sun’s SPARC processor would exceed 1G instructions per second in 10 years, and then talked about what amazing new applications such infinite computing would enable.</p><p>As wee engineers are, I was inspired, excited. A shade-wearing future😎! Then I got to thinking. Bill had taken the same trends used by other processor manufacturers &amp; then all he did was extrapolate further. They talked about 2 years, he talked about 10. Nice trick.</p><p>Another Extrapolate Further example is Limbo, my (as yet hypothetical) nano-deployment development infrastructure. I was at Facebook during a period of rapid growth. Lots of people were thinking about how to accommodate twice the engineers. I started thinking about 10X the engineers.</p><p>This Thinkie application compounded with another application of Extrapolate Further, this one about deployment frequency. As an industry we went from deploying annually to quarterly to monthly to weekly to daily to hourly. Skip a couple of increments &amp; ask about deploying every millisecond. What would be required to have 100,000 engineers work together on a system being deployed every millisecond?</p><p>Every growth trend eventually meets an inhibiting loop. Your simplistic projection will eventually no longer be valid. That’s okay. As a Thinkie, Extrapolate Further is just there to generate ideas for later validation.</p><p>Why is Extrapolate Further hard? I think because of the natural tribal tendencies of primates. No matter what kind of loner you are, it’s uncomfortable to stand out too far from the crowd. Extrapolate Further reminds me that it’s safe to generate ideas that don’t fit in. I’ll validate the ideas, Thinkie-style, before publishing them.</p>
