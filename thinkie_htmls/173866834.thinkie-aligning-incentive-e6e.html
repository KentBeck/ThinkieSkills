<p>Pattern: people are working at cross purposes.</p><p>Transformation: rather than tell people what to do to work together, give them an incentive that will indirectly require collaboration.</p><blockquote><p>WARNING! Any time I say “incentive”, some readers read, “Money! 💰!!!” Nope. Nope-ity nope. Yes, money is an incentive, but it is one of the most dangerous, most subject to Goodhart’s Curse. The strongest incentives uncover intrinsic motivations that were already there, just suppressed. Don’t pay people a dollar for each bug fixed.</p></blockquote><p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B0DFD2C9F9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27XQL8A40M607&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6mzb5vKzbDtFRh8Yk34RUyNpkhvJN7rCQZW3-YODCD3e6as7RC9OUVg4pHBPayoh57XWvtqk6L2Q9WmACrMR-KoLPDGf3VKazOYfqQUOB3lwqLmI6KDCIEZX0ar19dgU1QukBe5_MabommQUZdSWL8O8sMFVIEMbJso10jPEL4zfThizRcQMLUhz_tTQG7v7iUV-ZK6UBSJX4lapfq0f73uYqX6x6dr0Q74_PvUCT3o.dUB4O1F2iT1d6HrOZD8pDmqmH17ydsei6-MJ0frjgbQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+goal&amp;qid=1758198860&amp;sprefix=the+goal%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-1">The Goal</a></em> has a lovely Thinkie: Teaching Story about a group of scouts going on a hike. They have different fitness levels, so at first they spread out. The leaders get to the camp site quickly. At dusk they realize the slowest walkers haven’t appeared, so they go out in the darkness to find them. They finally round everyone up &amp; at midnight they collapse into their sleeping bags.</p><p>The next day the leader wants everyone to stay together. Rather than say, “Everyone stay together,” which isn’t going to work well with a bunch of rambunctious kids, they rope everyone together, with the slowest walkers in front. The rope is the Aligning Incentive.</p><p>In the story everyone redistributes the weight they are carrying so everyone’s pace is better matched, they all get to the next camp together, nobody gets lost, everybody lives happily ever after.</p><p>Not terribly realistic, but the impulse is right. Step back from “what’s to be done?” &amp; lead through incentives instead.</p>
