<p>I know it’s a cliche, but it’s a cliche because it works. And it’s a Thinkie because under stress it’s easy to forget.</p><p>Pattern: You’re stuck on a decision because someone is going to be negatively affected.</p><p>Transformation: What are solutions that would be good for everyone?</p><p>A recent example is me taking on sponsors. After going pro at content earlier this year I needed ways to increase my revenue to make up for my lost paycheck. Raise prices again? Bad for subscribers. Attract a bunch of new subscribers? Don’t know how to do that.</p><p>Sponsorships!</p><ul><li><p>Better for the sponsors (👋🏻 sponsors!) because they get their products exposed to more people.</p></li><li><p>Better for me because this newsletter becomes more sustainable.</p></li><li><p>Better for readers because they learn about useful products they might have otherwise missed.</p></li></ul><p>There’s also a danger in this that I’ll kid myself. Just because it’s good for me &amp; sponsors hey if it clutters up public posts a little well that’s too bad. This is the Evaluation portion of the Thinkie. Once Thinkie Win/Win has generated an idea, I need to be brutally honest with myself about the costs &amp; benefits for everyone affected.</p>
