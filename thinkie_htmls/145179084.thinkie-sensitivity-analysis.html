<p>Pattern: you need to tune the operation of a system with many inputs. Which dial to twist or lever to pull?</p><p>Transformation: pick an input that seems to matter. Vary it (in a model if possible). See if the output changes. If not, let it go.</p><p>My recent post on my motivation for writing <em>Tidy Together?</em> is an example of Sensitivity Analysis. I’m discouraged by the royalties I’m receiving. Does my feeling match the facts?</p><p>In the context of all of my sources of revenue, book royalties hardly matter. My financial situation is not sensitive to changes in book royalties, so let it go. My feelings are misleading me in this case.</p><p>Faced with a complex system, I have a tendency to fixate on one input. I can keep twiddling it long past the point that it should have been obvious that the input didn’t matter. This seems like a variation of Sunk Cost Fallacy.</p><p>Oh, here’s another example—shower temperature. I can slowly nudge the temperature up, but if the water heater is broken or if I’m turning the wrong knob, then I’ll never get the temperature I want. Applying Sensitivity Analysis, I crank the knob all the way over &amp; see (carefully) if anything changes. Only after I validate that the knob has an effect is it worth tweaking it.</p><p></p>
