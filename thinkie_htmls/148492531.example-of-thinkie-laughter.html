<blockquote><p>A Thinkie, for those of you non-paying-subscribers, is a habit of creative thought. I publish one to paying subscribers every Tuesday. I’ve published about 60 so far, with 30 to go. Thinkie: Laughter says that when laughter is the response to an idea, try taking the idea seriously for a second.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p></blockquote><p>“I have a dream! What if the business said to the geeks, ‘No, it’s okay. Take a little longer if you need to.”</p><p>I’ve whined repeatedly about how hard it is to find good examples. Well, I had one yesterday. I was presenting a workshop on leading geeks for non-technical executives (subscribe to https://leadgeekswithpurpose.substack.com/home if your C-suite would like to get on the waitlist for a session). The whole thing was going fairly well. I had talked about going for the brass ring because software scales. I had talked about features vs structure. NPV vs optionality. Impact » Effort. All the stuff you already know about as dedicated readers.</p><p>Then I said one thing that changed, not just the tone of the workshop, but also my own evaluation of the material I was presenting. And it wasn’t what I said that changed my brain, it was their reaction.</p><p>We were talking about jackpot changes—a seemingly-small change that takes a ridiculous (from the outside) amount of time. I explained how that happened (you know, coupling). How balanced investment in features &amp; structure reduces this problem. And then I decided to drop in one of my standard bits.</p><p>“I dream of a day when you folks ask for a feature and, when given an estimate, say, ‘It’s okay if you take a little more time.’” Big laugh. Nervous, but loud &amp; long.</p><p>The laugh stopped me for a moment. Then I continued, “And the geeks say, ‘No, we can do a little more than that.’”</p><p>Smaller laugh, but still, “What madness is this? That’s never going to happen.” Then silence as it sank in. Yeah, that <em>would</em> be good.</p><p>So that’s why I’m launching the workshop. It won’t be free. I’m not writing it up anywhere. It won’t be recorded or broadcast. On-site. In-person. I’ll only take one customer a month. Four hours, including exercises. For more details, see https://leadgeekswithpurpose.substack.com/home.</p><p>Ah, but the point of this post (I’m pretty excited about the workshop so I got off track), the point of this post is that I used Thinkie: Laughter. Their laughter sounded like fear of hope to me. They feared hoping that programming would ever be an abundant resource for them. And I think it can be. Even without AI magic fairy dust.</p><p>Oops, back to the point. The Thinkie helped me generate an idea—this message has enough attraction that it’s worth pushing out there. First I had to pay attention to that idea. Then evaluate it—yes, I could spread this message around. Now I’m taking the next step &amp; seeing how many more folks are willing to sign up (I have the first couple already).</p><p>Listen for laughter. There’s information there, &amp; unique information if everyone else is ignoring it.</p><p>P.S.
