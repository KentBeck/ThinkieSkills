<p>I had made a comment about how metrics-driven product development ends up <em>subtracting</em> value for users in the absence of foundational principles, using the example of the deterioration of the Fitbit experience. Alex replied:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apolyako">Alex Polyakov</a></p><p>Unfortunately some of us have to wear the pain on our bodies. As a diabetic, my insulin pump ( and I tried a ton of them ) is the worst case of useless functions and beeping and alerting that I'm sure makes sense to the FDA to approve, but is absolutely horrible. For example, an alert that says "I couldn't deliver you insulin because the amount is too small". Mind you this is for automatic mode - when the pump works like artificial pancreas automatically delivering the insulin based on the Dexcom sensor. Another example, You need more insulin, but exceeded what we feel is a volume limit for automatic delivery, the pump again beeps for no reason - especially annoying at night, just to wake up and click the "ok" button. Or, an alert that goes off at night that your sensor will expire in 24 hours. Useless. Better would be not to alert me for BS reasons to reasons that aren't critical during the rest time. There are more. I wrote to all insulin pump companies with all feedback - not even a reply...</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kentbeck">Kent Beck</a></p><p>Maybe if the Product Owner wore an insulin pump?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apolyako">Alex Polyakov</a></p><p>That would be nice, or just have a healthy person wear it pretending they need it. Anything better than what seems like just system "requirements"</p></blockquote><p>Thinkie alert! This is a great example of me using a Thinkie. I read Alex’ heartbreaking message, matched the pattern, &amp; suggested the idea that the Thinkie generated.</p><p>Pattern: Someone needs to make better decisions. They have plenty of information. They just aren’t using it well.</p><p>Transformation: Re-arrange feedback so the decision maker directly experiences the consequences of their decisions.</p><p>World War II aircraft maintenance chiefs would fly along on the first ride after major repairs. The Code of Hammurabi dictates that a builder who builds a house that collapses &amp; kills the owner will themselves be killed.</p><p>Putting skin in the game may seem like harsh justice but the net effect is to reduce harm. The mechanic who will die if their work puts the pilot at risk will not work in a way that will put the pilot at risk.</p><p>Extending the example above, the device designer should be wearing an insulin pump, using today’s version of the software. “But these ‘requirements’ come from the FDA.” Okay, then the FDA auditor should also be wearing a pump. If they are already accepting responsibility for millions of lives, it’s a small additional sacrifice.</p><p>As with all Thinkies, the generated idea needs to be evaluated. It would be a big change for product owners, I’m sure, a big investment. But compared to the potential benefit?</p>
