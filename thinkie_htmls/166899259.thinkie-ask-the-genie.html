<p>Pattern: You have a question, any question, especially a question you have tended to abandon because it would be too much work.</p><p>Transformation: Ask the genie.</p><p>This is a habit. A new habit. But a habit. A highly profitable but also highly variable habit. That is, sometimes the genie has a great answer &amp; sometimes just distraction, but the great answers are really great &amp; not something you would come up with another way.</p><p>Josh Cannon taught me this. Every time I would ask him a question he’d say, “Ask Claude!” Eventually that voice started playing in my head without me having to wait for him.</p><p>My most profound experience of this came when <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;MelancholyYuga&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:2521808,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:null,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;19a39c54-4087-401c-9548-d4cc83d5675a&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> mentioned <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/tidyfirst/p/anatomy-of-oscillation?r=ehk17&amp;utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;comments=true&amp;commentId=93510766">eigenvalues</a>. I sighed &amp; shrugged my shoulders, having avoided for decades digging that far into matrix math. Then I thought, “Wait a minute! Genie, teach me about eigenvalues.”</p><p>We had to go back &amp; forth a bit. I pushed back on the examples that didn’t make sense &amp; indeed the genie was wrong sometimes &amp; sometimes I just didn’t understand yet. A half hour later I had a bit of an intuition about eigenvalues &amp; their relationship to oscillation. Not enough to teach you, but enough for me for now. And that chat is still sitting there if I want to dig deeper.</p><p>So, every time you ask yourself, “I wonder…”, try to quickly figure out a way to ask the genie.
