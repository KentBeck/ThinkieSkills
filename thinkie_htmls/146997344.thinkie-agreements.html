This stretches the scope of Thinkies a bit. It’s almost like self-help or inter-personal advice. However, I store these techniques in the same box as the rest of my Thinkies, so I think it belongs. Thoughts?</p></blockquote><p>Pattern: You are locked in an argument &amp; you want progress.</p><p>Transformation: Pause &amp; make a list of everything you agree on.</p><p>“Heated Agreement” is an apparent argument where the participants are committed to the conversational form of arguing without actually disagreeing. It’s useful to catch heated agreement early. Then if you want to go on yelling at each other, fine, but also maybe you both have better things to do.</p><p>Once adrenaline &amp; cortisol are pumping, though, it’s hard to get out of the back-and-forth. Agreements gives you space &amp; time to evaluate the conversation itself, to focus on the actual issues, &amp; (potentially) make progress. Maybe you realize you don’t actually have an argument. Maybe you realize you’re so far apart that further conversation is worthless. Maybe you figure out the actual issue.</p>
