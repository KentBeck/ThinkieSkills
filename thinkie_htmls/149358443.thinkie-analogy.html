<p>Pattern: you’re struggling to explain a concept</p><p>Transformation: explain it in terms of another domain your listener already understands</p><p>Wow! This seems so simplistic when written down like this, but if it’s really so simple then why don’t more people do it?</p><p>Here’s the thing—analogizing gets easier with practice. And the Thinkie Motto applies—generate <em>then</em> evaluate. It’s like this, it’s like that, maybe it’s like this other. Get in the habit.</p><p>Analogies come easier to me at some times than others. My mood affects my ability to make analogies. Recently I was on a course of steroids &amp; part of the general heightened energy was an easier flow of analogies. I talked with a writer who claimed that marijuana use encouraged analogies.</p><p>A bit of nerdy background, from “Metaphors We Live By” by Lakoff &amp; Johnson—analogies (&amp; similar figurative language) have these components:</p><ul><li><p>Source domain—the (usually concrete) domain we are using for an explanation.</p></li><li><p>Destination domain—the domain we are explaining.</p></li><li><p>Mapping—the way the elements of the source domain map to elements of the destination domain.</p></li><li><p>Entailments—the way the mapping leads to understanding of the destination domain given understanding of the source domain.</p></li></ul><p>Analogies are always a dance of is &amp; is not. We don’t mean that a software schedule is actually a highway map. Some ways yes, some ways no. Part of the problem comes when we take an analogy so far that the mapping becomes absurd.</p><p>I had a conversation the other day about roadmaps (you know, the software project management kind). The roadmap analogy depends on the roads not changing much. In software we have collapses &amp; washouts &amp; new construction all the time. I said the plan should describe the destination, not the roads. </p>
