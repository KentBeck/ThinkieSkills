<p>Pattern: you’re faced with a confusing situation &amp; you don’t know what to do next.</p><p>Transformation: take a model or an analogy or a frame &amp; just apply it.</p><p>Don’t worry about whether the model “makes sense”. (This applies the Thinkie Separate Observation From Judgement) ((Me using a Thinkie to explain a Thinkie applies the Thinkie Self Description)). Just apply it. Naively.</p><p>Examples (always the hard part):</p><ul><li><p>If this was a queueing theory problem, what are the parts? What are the stations? What are the connections between stations? How is demand signaled? What is the distribution of latency, throughput, &amp; variance? Where are buffers?</p></li><li><p>If this was a social revolution, who gains from the status quo? How is status signaled? How is power exercised? Where are the leverage points? Who are allies?</p></li><li><p>If this was an optimization problem, what is the fitness function? What are the dimensions of the payoff landscape? What level constitutes “under water” (unacceptable solutions, even temporarily)? What is the shape of the payoff landscape? How can we change the shape of the payoff landscape? How do you move on the landscape? Can you change how you move—direction, speed, step size?</p></li><li><p>If this was a business, what are the assets, liabilities, income, &amp; expenses?</p></li><li><p>If this was a marketing campaign, what are the messages, audience, media?</p></li></ul><p>The more frames you’re practiced with, the more chances you have to get unstuck.</p><p>The goal of Just Apply is not to truly, deeply understand your situation before you act. It’s to temporarily simplify your understanding so fear of action subsides. You do something (preferably something reversible), learn a lesson, prepare for the next action.</p><p>Just Apply is a more general form of the Thinkie Hold Your Nose &amp; Do The Math. It also illustrates the general principle that Thinkies generate ideas, not good ideas. Your analogy may be horrible, or just not illuminating, but even the evaluation will teach you a lesson.</p>
