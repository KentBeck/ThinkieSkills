<p>Pattern: You’re trying to understand if a trend is significant.</p><p>Transformation: Look at its growth rate, not its current size.</p><p>(Example from an American perspective.) Early in COVID pundits were comparing it to traffic fatalities. “50,000 people die on the road every year &amp; we don’t shut down the whole economy as a result. We are on track for 50,000 COVID deaths. Stop panicking.”</p><p>The fallacy of this thinking is not the absolute numbers. As a society we choose 50K annual deaths as an acceptable tradeoff with transportation cost &amp; speed. Okay. But  50K traffic deaths are not comparable to 50K COVID deaths. The difference is the growth rate.</p><p>If 50K traffic deaths were on track to become 60K there would indeed be a societal response, because that is rapid growth for a number that seems to have topped out. 50K COVID deaths had a built-in growth factor, eventually becoming 1.1M deaths. Treating them the same is a category error.</p><p>“Large language models write mediocre text. Therefore we should ignore them.” — this is the mistake Growth Rate is intended to avoid. How fast are models getting better? That’s the question. If they are awful but improving quickly, that is a completely different trend than if they are okay but not improving much. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bgiD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bgiD!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bgiD!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bgiD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bgiD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic" width="1456" height="842" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/624c31a4-33fb-4fe9-8ba0-3e779e7265ee_2129x1231.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:842,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:140097,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;In the early part of the logistic curve, ask about growth rate.

When the Hype Train is fully passengered, then you can think new thoughts by asking when it will slow down. Turns out the improvement in models was driven by ingesting more &amp; more text. Now all the text has been ingested &amp; further progress will only come with (relatively greater) effort.</p>
