<p>Pattern: you’re having trouble making progress in a situation.</p><p>Transformation: list the properties that would set the situation up perfectly for success. Back off only reluctantly.</p><p>Too often the reason we’re not making progress isn’t our effort, but our context. We get used to the proverbial pebble in our shoe &amp; complain about our walking speed instead of taking the damn pebble out.</p><p>Poker is a great example of this for me. The perfect setup for a profitable poker session is:</p><ul><li><p>Good sleep the night before.</p></li><li><p>Meditation.</p></li><li><p>Exercise.</p></li><li><p>Eating well.</p></li><li><p>Feeling sharp &amp; confident.</p></li><li><p>Have a learning goal.</p></li><li><p>Pick the most profitable game.</p></li><li><p>Pick the table with the weakest opponents.</p></li><li><p>Have 2 conservative players taking their turns right after mine.</p></li><li><p>Have 1-2 players who don’t care about money/are drunk/are easy to read taking their turns right before mine.</p></li></ul><p>If I have a session set up like this, it’s bound to be advantageous. (I can still lose short-term because hey poker.)</p><p>What of these properties are optional? If I want to play profitably, I should insist to myself on all the properties that are under my control. Do I? No, but more &amp; more over time.</p><p>Extreme Programming is an exercise in Thinkie Perfect Setup. Strong social ties. Rapid feedback at all scales. Constant adjustment to evolving reality.</p><p>People’s reaction to XP often amazed me. “Well, of course if we had a customer on the team we’d succeed.” Um, okay?</p><p>I’m not so interested in how we can eek out some progress in a nearly-impossible situation. How can we set the situation up for success &amp; keep it set up for success?</p>
